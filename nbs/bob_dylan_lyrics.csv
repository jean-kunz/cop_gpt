1961,"The Bootleg Series, Vol 1-3: Rare & Unreleased 1961-1991",Hard Times In New York Town,"Come you ladies and you gentlemen, a-listen to my song

Sing it to you right, but you might think it’s wrong

Just a little glimpse of a story I’ll tell

’Bout an East Coast city that you all know well

It’s hard times in the city

Livin’ down in New York town



Old New York City is a friendly old town

From Washington Heights to Harlem on down

There’s a-mighty many people all millin’ all around

They’ll kick you when you’re up and knock you when you’re down

It’s hard times in the city

Livin’ down in New York town



It’s a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate

To Rockefeller Plaza ’n’ the Empire State.

Mister Rockefeller sets up as high as a bird

Old Mister Empire never says a word

It’s hard times from the country

Livin’ down in New York town



Well, it’s up in the mornin’ tryin’ to find a job of work

Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt

If you got a lot o’ money you can make yourself merry

If you only got a nickel, it’s the Staten Island Ferry

And it’s hard times in the city

Livin’ down in New York town



Mister Hudson come a-sailin’ down the stream

And old Mister Minuet paid for his dream

Bought your city on a one-way track

’F I had my way I’d sell it right back

And it’s hard times in the city

Livin’ down in New York town



I’ll take all the smog in Cal-i-for-ne-ay

’N’ every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains

’N’ the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines

It’s all much cleaner than the New York kind

And it’s hard times in the city

Livin’ down in New York town



So all you newsy people, spread the news around

You c’n listen to m’ story, listen to m’ song

You c’n step on my name, you c’n try ’n’ get me beat

When I leave New York, I’ll be standin’ on my feet

And it’s hard times in the city

Livin’ down in New York town"
1961,"The Bootleg Series, Vol 1-3: Rare & Unreleased 1961-1991",Man on the street,"’ll sing you a song, ain’t very long

’Bout an old man who never done wrong

How he died nobody can say

They found him dead in the street one day



Well, the crowd, they gathered one fine morn

At the man whose clothes ’n’ shoes were torn

There on the sidewalk he did lay

They stopped ’n’ stared ’n’ walked their way



Well, the p’liceman come and he looked around

“Get up, old man, or I’m a-takin’ you down”

He jabbed him once with his billy club

And the old man then rolled off the curb



Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said

“Call the wagon; this man is dead”

The wagon come, they loaded him in

I never saw the man again



I’ve sung you my song, it ain’t very long

’Bout an old man who never done wrong

How he died no one can say

They found him dead in the street one day"
1962,"The Bootleg Series, Vol 1-3: Rare & Unreleased 1961-1991",Talkin’ Bear Mountain Picnic Massacre Blues,"I saw it advertised one day

Bear Mountain picnic was comin’ my way

“Come along ’n’ take a trip

We’ll bring you up there on a ship

Bring the wife and kids

Bring the whole family”

Yippee!



Well, I run right down ’n’ bought a ticket

To this Bear Mountain Picnic

But little did I realize

I was in for a picnic surprise

Had nothin’ to do with mountains

I didn’t even come close to a bear



Took the wife ’n’ kids down to the pier

Six thousand people there

Everybody had a ticket for the trip

“Oh well,” I said, “it’s a pretty big ship

Besides, anyway, the more the merrier”



Well, we all got on ’n’ what d’ya think

That big old boat started t’ sink

More people kept a-pilin’ on

That old ship was a-slowly goin’ down

Funny way t’ start a picnic



Well, I soon lost track of m’ kids ’n’ wife

So many people there I never saw in m’ life

That old ship sinkin’ down in the water

Six thousand people tryin’ t’ kill each other

Dogs a-barkin’, cats a-meowin’

Women screamin’, fists a-flyin’, babies cryin’

Cops a-comin’, me a-runnin’

Maybe we just better call off the picnic



I got shoved down ’n’ pushed around

All I could hear there was a screamin’ sound

Don’t remember one thing more

Just remember wakin’ up on a little shore

Head busted, stomach cracked

Feet splintered, I was bald, naked . . .

Quite lucky to be alive though



Feelin’ like I climbed outa m’ casket

I grabbed back hold of m’ picnic basket

Took the wife ’n’ kids ’n’ started home

Wishin’ I’d never got up that morn



Now, I don’t care just what you do

If you wanta have a picnic, that’s up t’ you

But don’t tell me about it, I don’t wanta hear it

’Cause, see, I just lost all m’ picnic spirit

Stay in m’ kitchen, have m’ own picnic . . .

In the bathroom



Now, it don’t seem to me quite so funny

What some people are gonna do f’r money

There’s a bran’ new gimmick every day

Just t’ take somebody’s money away

I think we oughta take some o’ these people

And put ’em on a boat, send ’em up to Bear Mountain . . .

For a picnic

1962,"The Bootleg Series, Vol 1-3: Rare & Unreleased 1961-1991",Let Me Die in My Footsteps,"I will not go down under the ground

’Cause somebody tells me that death’s comin’ ’round

An’ I will not carry myself down to die

When I go to my grave my head will be high

Let me die in my footsteps

Before I go down under the ground



There’s been rumors of war and wars that have been

The meaning of life has been lost in the wind

And some people thinkin’ that the end is close by

’Stead of learnin’ to live they are learnin’ to die

Let me die in my footsteps

Before I go down under the ground



I don’t know if I’m smart but I think I can see

When someone is pullin’ the wool over me

And if this war comes and death’s all around

Let me die on this land ’fore I die underground

Let me die in my footsteps

Before I go down under the ground



There’s always been people that have to cause fear

They’ve been talking of the war now for many long years

I have read all their statements and I’ve not said a word

But now Lawd God, let my poor voice be heard

Let me die in my footsteps

Before I go down under the ground



If I had rubies and riches and crowns

I’d buy the whole world and change things around

I’d throw all the guns and the tanks in the sea

For they are mistakes of a past history

Let me die in my footsteps

Before I go down under the ground



Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood

Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood

Let me sleep in your meadows with the green grassy leaves

Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace

Let me die in my footsteps

Before I go down under the ground



Go out in your country where the land meets the sun

See the craters and the canyons where the waterfalls run

Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho

Let every state in this union seep down deep in your souls

And you’ll die in your footsteps

Before you go down under the ground"
1962,"The Bootleg Series, Vol 1-3: Rare & Unreleased 1961-1991","Rambling, Gambling Willie","Come around you rovin’ gamblers and a story I will tell

About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well

His name was Will O’Conley and he gambled all his life

He had twenty-seven children, yet he never had a wife

And it’s ride, Willie, ride

Roll, Willie, roll

Wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows



He gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards

Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards

He had the reputation as the gamblin’est man around

Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town

And it’s ride, Willie, ride

Roll, Willie, roll

Wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows



Sailin’ down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans

They’re still talkin’ about their card game on that Jackson River Queen

“I’ve come to win some money,” Gamblin’ Willie says

When the game finally ended up, the whole damn boat was his

And it’s ride, Willie, ride

Roll, Willie, roll

Wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows



Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek

There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week

Nine hundred miners had laid their money down

When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole damn town

And it’s ride, Willie, ride

Roll, Willie, roll

Wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows



But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true

He supported all his children and all their mothers too

He wore no rings or fancy things, like other gamblers wore

He spread his money far and wide, to help the sick and the poor

And it’s ride, Willie, ride

Roll, Willie, roll

Wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows



When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew

Whether he was bluffin’ or whether he was true

He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair

The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn’t even have a pair

And it’s ride, Willie, ride

Roll, Willie, roll

Wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows



It was late one evenin’ during a poker game

A man lost all his money, he said Willie was to blame

He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate

When Willie’s cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights

And it’s ride, Willie, ride

Roll, Willie, roll

Wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows



So all you rovin’ gamblers, wherever you might be

The moral of the story is very plain to see

Make your money while you can, before you have to stop

For when you pull that dead man’s hand, your gamblin’ days are up

And it’s ride, Willie, ride

Roll, Willie, roll

Wherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows"

1962,Bob Dylan,Talkin' New York,"Ramblin’ outa the wild West
 
 Leavin’ the towns I love the best
 
 Thought I’d seen some ups and downs
 
 ’Til I come into New York town
 
 People goin’ down to the ground
 
 Buildings goin’ up to the sky
 
 
 
 Wintertime in New York town
 
 The wind blowin’ snow around
 
 Walk around with nowhere to go
 
 Somebody could freeze right to the bone
 
 I froze right to the bone
 
 New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years
 
 I didn’t feel so cold then
 
 
 
 I swung onto my old guitar
 
 Grabbed hold of a subway car
 
 And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
 
 I landed up on the downtown side
 
 Greenwich Village
 
 
 
 I walked down there and ended up
 
 In one of them coffee-houses on the block
 
 Got on the stage to sing and play
 
 Man there said, “Come back some other day
 
 You sound like a hillbilly
 
 We want folk singers here”
 
 
 
 Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play
 
 Blowin’ my lungs out for a dollar a day
 
 I blowed inside out and upside down
 
 The man there said he loved m’ sound
 
 He was ravin’ about how he loved m’ sound
 
 Dollar a day’s worth
 
 
 
 And after weeks and weeks of hangin’ around
 
 I finally got a job in New York town
 
 In a bigger place, bigger money too
 
 Even joined the union and paid m’ dues
 
 
 
 Now, a very great man once said
 
 That some people rob you with a fountain pen
 
 It didn’t take too long to find out
 
 Just what he was talkin’ about
 
 A lot of people don’t have much food on their table
 
 But they got a lot of forks ’n’ knives
 
 And they gotta cut somethin’
 
 
 
 So one mornin’ when the sun was warm
 
 I rambled out of New York town
 
 Pulled my cap down over my eyes
 
 And headed out for the western skies
 
 So long, New York
 
 Howdy, East Orange"
1962,Bob Dylan,Song to Woody,"I’m out here a thousand miles from my home
 
 Walkin’ a road other men have gone down
 
 I’m seein’ your world of people and things
 
 Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings
 
 
 
 Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
 
 ’Bout a funny ol’ world that’s a-comin’ along
 
 Seems sick an’ it’s hungry, it’s tired an’ it’s torn
 
 It looks like it’s a-dyin’ an’ it’s hardly been born
 
 
 
 Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
 
 All the things that I’m a-sayin’ an’ a-many times more
 
 I’m a-singin’ you the song, but I can’t sing enough
 
 ’Cause there’s not many men that done the things that you’ve done
 
 
 
 Here’s to Cisco an’ Sonny an’ Leadbelly too
 
 An’ to all the good people that traveled with you
 
 Here’s to the hearts and the hands of the men
 
 That come with the dust and are gone with the wind
 
 
 
 I’m a-leavin’ tomorrow, but I could leave today
 
 Somewhere down the road someday
 
 The very last thing that I’d want to do
 
 Is to say I’ve been hittin’ some hard travelin’ too"

Why an’ what’s the reason for?



“Not I,” says the referee

“Don’t point your finger at me

I could’ve stopped it in the eighth

An’ maybe kept him from his fate

But the crowd would’ve booed, I’m sure

At not gettin’ their money’s worth

It’s too bad he had to go

But there was a pressure on me too, you know

It wasn’t me that made him fall

No, you can’t blame me at all”



Who killed Davey Moore

“Not us,” says the angry crowd

Whose screams filled the arena loud

“It’s too bad he died that night

But we just like to see a fight

We didn’t mean for him t’ meet his death

We just meant to see some sweat

There ain’t nothing wrong in that

It wasn’t us that made him fall

No, you can’t blame us at all”

“Not me,” says his manager

Puffing on a big cigar

“It’s hard to say, it’s hard to tell

But if he was sick, he should’ve said

It wasn’t me that made him fall

No, you can’t blame me at all”

With his ticket stub still in his hand

Pounding print on his old typewriter

Laid him low in a cloud of mist

I didn’t know what in the world I wus gonna do

Them Communists they wus comin’ around

They wus in the air

They wus on the ground

They wouldn’t gimme no peace . . .



So I run down most hurriedly

And joined up with the John Birch Society

I got me a secret membership card

And started off a-walkin’ down the road

Yee-hoo, I’m a real John Bircher now!

Look out you Commies!



Now we all agree with Hitler’s views

Although he killed six million Jews

It don’t matter too much that he was a Fascist

At least you can’t say he was a Communist!

That’s to say like if you got a cold you take a shot of malaria



Well, I wus lookin’ everywhere for them gol-darned Reds

I got up in the mornin’ ’n’ looked under my bed

Looked in the sink, behind the door

Looked in the glove compartment of my car

Couldn’t find ’em . . .



I wus lookin’ high an’ low for them Reds everywhere

I wus lookin’ in the sink an’ underneath the chair

I looked way up my chimney hole

I even looked deep down inside my toilet bowl

They got away . . .



Well, I wus sittin’ home alone an’ started to sweat

Figured they wus in my T.V. set

Peeked behind the picture frame

Got a shock from my feet, hittin’ right up in the brain

Them Reds caused it!

I know they did . . . them hard-core ones



Well, I quit my job so I could work all alone

Then I changed my name to Sherlock Holmes

Followed some clues from my detective bag

And discovered they wus red stripes on the American flag!

That ol’ Betsy Ross . . .



Well, I investigated all the books in the library

Ninety percent of ’em gotta be burned away

I investigated all the people that I knowed

Ninety-eight percent of them gotta go

The other two percent are fellow Birchers . . . just like me



Now Eisenhower, he’s a Russian spy

Lincoln, Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy

To my knowledge there’s just one man

That’s really a true American: George Lincoln Rockwell

I know for a fact he hates Commies cus he picketed the movie Exodus



Well, I fin’ly started thinkin’ straight

When I run outa things to investigate

Couldn’t imagine doin’ anything else

So now I’m sittin’ home investigatin’ myself!

Hope I don’t find out anything . . . hmm, great God!

I remember quite freely:

No younger than twelve

No older ’n seventeen

Thrown in like bandits

And cast off like criminals

Inside the walls

The walls of Red Wing



From the dirty old mess hall

You march to the brick wall

Too weary to talk

And too tired to sing

Oh, it’s all afternoon

You remember your hometown

Inside the walls

The walls of Red Wing



Oh, the gates are cast iron

And the walls are barbed wire

Stay far from the fence

With the ’lectricity sting

And it’s keep down your head

And stay in your number

Inside the walls

The walls of Red Wing



Oh, it’s fare thee well

To the deep hollow dungeon

Farewell to the boardwalk

That takes you to the screen

And farewell to the minutes

They threaten you with it

Inside the walls

The walls of Red Wing



It’s many a guard

That stands around smilin’

Holdin’ his club

Like he was a king

Hopin’ to get you

Behind a wood pilin’

Inside the walls

The walls of Red Wing



The night aimed shadows

Through the crossbar windows

And the wind punched hard

To make the wall-siding sing

It’s many a night

I pretended to be a-sleepin’

Inside the walls

The walls of Red Wing



As the rain rattled heavy

On the bunkhouse shingles

And the sounds in the night

They made my ears ring

’Til the keys of the guards

Clicked the tune of the morning

Inside the walls

The walls of Red Wing



Oh, some of us’ll end up

In St. Cloud Prison

And some of us’ll wind up

To be lawyers and things

And some of us’ll stand up

To meet you on your crossroads

1963,"The Bootleg Series, Vol 1-3: Rare & Unreleased 1961-1991",Last Thoughts On Woody Guthrie,"When yer head gets twisted and yer mind grows numb

When you think you're too old, too young, too smart or too dumb

When yer laggin' behind an' losin' yer pace

In a slow-motion crawl of life's busy race

No matter what yer doing if you start givin' up

If the wine don't come to the top of yer cup

If the wind's got you sideways with with one hand holdin' on

And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone

And yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it

And the wood's easy findin' but yer lazy to fetch it

And yer sidewalk starts curlin' and the street gets too long

And you start walkin' backwards though you know its wrong

And lonesome comes up as down goes the day

And tomorrow's mornin' seems so far away

And you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin'

And yer rope is a-slidin' 'cause yer hands are a-drippin'

And yer sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys

Turn to broken down slums and trash-can alleys

And yer sky cries water and yer drain pipe's a-pourin'

And the lightnin's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashin'

And the windows are rattlin' and breakin' and the roof tops a-shakin'

And yer whole world's a-slammin' and bangin'

And yer minutes of sun turn to hours of storm

And to yourself you sometimes say

""I never knew it was gonna be this way

Why didn't they tell me the day I was born""

And you start gettin' chills and yer jumping from sweat

And you're lookin' for somethin' you ain't quite found yet

And yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the air

And the whole world's a-watchin' with a window peek stare

And yer good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying

And yer heart feels sick like fish when they're fryin'

And yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feet

And you need it badly but it lays on the street

And yer bell's bangin' loudly but you can't hear its beat

And you think yer ears might a been hurt

Or yer eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blindin' dirt

And you figured you failed in yesterdays rush

When you were faked out an' fooled white facing a four flush

And all the time you were holdin' three queens

And it's makin you mad, it's makin' you mean

Like in the middle of Life magazine

Bouncin' around a pinball machine

And there's something on yer mind you wanna be saying

That somebody someplace oughta be hearin'

But it's trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer head

And it bothers you badly when your layin' in bed

And no matter how you try you just can't say it

And yer scared to yer soul you just might forget it

And yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer head

And yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead

And the lion's mouth opens and yer staring at his teeth

And his jaws start closin with you underneath

And yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behind

And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign

And you say to yourself just what am I doin'

On this road I'm walkin', on this trail I'm turnin'

On this curve I'm hanging

On this pathway I'm strolling, in the space I'm taking

In this air I'm inhaling

Am I mixed up too much, am I mixed up too hard

Why am I walking, where am I running

What am I saying, what am I knowing

On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm frailin'

On this mandolin I'm strummin', in the song I'm singin'

In the tune I'm hummin', in the words I'm writin'

In the words that I'm thinkin'

In this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinkin'

Who am I helping, what am I breaking

What am I giving, what am I taking

But you try with your whole soul best

Never to think these thoughts and never to let

Them kind of thoughts gain ground

Or make yer heart pound

But then again you know why they're around

Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down

""Cause sometimes you hear'em when the night times comes creeping

And you fear that they might catch you a-sleeping

And you jump from yer bed, from yer last chapter of dreamin'

And you can't remember for the best of yer thinking

If that was you in the dream that was screaming

And you know that it's something special you're needin'

And you know that there's no drug that'll do for the healin'

And no liquor in the land to stop yer brain from bleeding

And you need something special

Yeah, you need something special all right

You need a fast flyin' train on a tornado track

To shoot you someplace and shoot you back

You need a cyclone wind on a stream engine howler

That's been banging and booming and blowing forever

That knows yer troubles a hundred times over

You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race

That won't laugh at yer looks

Your voice or your face

And by any number of bets in the book

Will be rollin' long after the bubblegum craze

You need something to open up a new door

To show you something you seen before

But overlooked a hundred times or more

You need something to open your eyes

You need something to make it known

That it's you and no one else that owns

That spot that yer standing, that space that you're sitting

That the world ain't got you beat

That it ain't got you licked

It can't get you crazy no matter how many

Times you might get kicked

You need something special all right

You need something special to give you hope

But hope's just a word

That maybe you said or maybe you heard

On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve



But that's what you need man, and you need it bad

And yer trouble is you know it too good

""Cause you look an' you start getting the chills



""Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill

And it ain't on Macy's window sill

And it ain't on no rich kid's road map

And it ain't in no fat kid's fraternity house

And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ

And it ain't on that dimlit stage

With that half-wit comedian on it

Ranting and raving and taking yer money

And you thinks it's funny

No you can't find it in no night club or no yacht club

And it ain't in the seats of a supper club

And sure as hell you're bound to tell

That no matter how hard you rub

You just ain't a-gonna find it on yer ticket stub

No, and it ain't in the rumors people're tellin' you

And it ain't in the pimple-lotion people are sellin' you

And it ain't in no cardboard-box house

Or down any movie star's blouse

And you can't find it on the golf course

And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus

And it ain't in the cream puff hair-do or cotton candy clothes

And it ain't in the dime store dummies or bubblegum goons

And it ain't in the marshmallow noises of the chocolate cake voices

That come knockin' and tappin' in Christmas wrappin'

Sayin' ain't I pretty and ain't I cute and look at my skin

Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow

Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry

When you can't even sense if they got any insides

These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows

No you'll not now or no other day

Find it on the doorsteps made out-a paper mache¥

And inside it the people made of molasses

That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses

And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies

Who'd turn yuh in for a tenth of a penny

Who breathe and burp and bend and crack

And before you can count from one to ten

Do it all over again but this time behind yer back

My friend

The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl

And play games with each other in their sand-box world

And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools

That run around gallant

And make all rules for the ones that got talent

And it ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do

And think they're foolin' you

The ones who jump on the wagon

Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style

To get their kicks, get out of it quick

And make all kinds of money and chicks

And you yell to yourself and you throw down yer hat

Sayin', ""Christ do I gotta be like that

Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at

Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel

Good God Almighty

THAT STUFF AIN'T REAL""



No but that ain't yer game, it ain't even yer race

You can't hear yer name, you can't see yer face

You gotta look some other place

And where do you look for this hope that yer seekin'

Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burnin'

Where do you look for this oil well gushin'

Where do you look for this candle that's glowin'

Where do you look for this hope that you know is there

And out there somewhere

And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads

Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows

Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways

You can touch and twist

And turn two kinds of doorknobs

You can either go to the church of your choice

Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital

You'll find God in the church of your choice

You'll find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital



And though it's only my opinion

I may be right or wrong

You'll find them both

In the Grand Canyon

At sundown"

 I can see through your masks
 
 
 
 You that never done nothin’

 You play with my world
 
 Like it’s your little toy
 
 You put a gun in my hand
 
 And you hide from my eyes
 
 And you turn and run farther
 
 When the fast bullets fly
 
 
 
 Like Judas of old
 
 You lie and deceive
 
 A world war can be won
 
 You want me to believe
 
 But I see through your eyes
 
 And I see through your brain
 
 Like I see through the water
 
 That runs down my drain
 
 
 
 You fasten the triggers
 
 For the others to fire
 
 Then you set back and watch
 
 When the death count gets higher
 
 You hide in your mansion
 
 As young people’s blood
 
 Flows out of their bodies
 
 And is buried in the mud
 
 
 
 You’ve thrown the worst fear
 
 That can ever be hurled
 
 Fear to bring children
 
 Into the world
 
 For threatening my baby
 
 Unborn and unnamed
 
 You ain’t worth the blood
 
 That runs in your veins
 
 
 
 How much do I know
 
 To talk out of turn
 
 You might say that I’m young
 
 You might say I’m unlearned
 
 But there’s one thing I know
 
 Though I’m younger than you
 
 Even Jesus would never
 
 Forgive what you do
 
 
 
 Let me ask you one question
 
 Is your money that good
 
 Will it buy you forgiveness
 
 Do you think that it could
 
 I think you will find
 
 When your death takes its toll
 
 All the money you made
 
 Will never buy back your soul
 
 
 
 And I hope that you die
 
 And your death’ll come soon
 
 I will follow your casket
 
 In the pale afternoon
 
 And I’ll watch while you’re lowered
 
 Down to your deathbed
 
 And I’ll stand o’er your grave
 
 ’Til I’m sure that you’re dead"

1963,"The Bootleg Series, Vol 1-3: Rare & Unreleased 1961-1991",Only a Hobo,"As I was out walking on a corner one day

I spied an old hobo, in a doorway he lay

His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor

And I guess he’d been there for the whole night or more



Only a hobo, but one more is gone

Leavin’ nobody to sing his sad song

Leavin’ nobody to carry him home

Only a hobo, but one more is gone



A blanket of newspaper covered his head

As the curb was his pillow, the street was his bed

One look at his face showed the hard road he’d come

And a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed



Only a hobo, but one more is gone

Leavin’ nobody to sing his sad song

Leavin’ nobody to carry him home

Only a hobo, but one more is gone



Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down

To look up on the world from a hole in the ground

To wait for your future like a horse that’s gone lame

To lie in the gutter and die with no name?



Only a hobo, but one more is gone

Leavin’ nobody to sing his sad song

Leavin’ nobody to carry him home

Only a hobo, but one more is gone"

 If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
 
 Please see for me if her hair hangs long,
 
 That’s the way I remember her best.

 Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?
 
 I’ve stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
 
 I’ve walked and I’ve crawled on six crooked highways
 
 I’ve stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
 
 I’ve been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
 
 I’ve been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
 
 And it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, and it’s a hard
 
 And it’s a hard rain’s a-gonna fall
 
 
 
 Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
 
 Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?
 
 I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
 
 I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
 
 I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin’
 
 I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin’
 
 I saw a white ladder all covered with water
 
 I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
 
 I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children

 And it’s a hard rain’s a-gonna fall
 
 
 
 And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
 
 And what did you hear, my darling young one?
 
 I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin’
 
 Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
 
 Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin’
 
 Heard ten thousand whisperin’ and nobody listenin’
 
 Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin’
 
 Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
 
 Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley

 And it’s a hard rain’s a-gonna fall
 
 
 
 Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
 
 Who did you meet, my darling young one?
 
 I met a young child beside a dead pony
 
 I met a white man who walked a black dog
 
 I met a young woman whose body was burning
 
 I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
 
 I met one man who was wounded in love
 
 I met another man who was wounded with hatred

 Oh, what’ll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
 
 Oh, what’ll you do now, my darling young one?
 
 I’m a-goin’ back out ’fore the rain starts a-fallin’
 
 I’ll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest
 
 Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
 
 Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
 
 Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
 
 Where the executioner’s face is always well hidden
 
 Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten
 
 Where black is the color, where none is the number
 
 And I’ll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it
 
 And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it
 
 Then I’ll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin’
 
 But I’ll know my song well before I start singin’
 
 And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard

1963,"The Bootleg Series, Vol 1-3: Rare & Unreleased 1961-1991",Eternal Circle,"I sang the song slowly

As she stood in the shadows

She stepped to the light

As my silver strings spun

She called with her eyes

To the tune I’s a-playin’

But the song it was long

And I’d only begun



Through a bullet of light

Her face was reflectin’

The fast fading words

That rolled from my tongue

With a long-distance look

Her eyes was on fire

But the song it was long

And there was more to be sung



My eyes danced a circle

Across her clear outline

With her head tilted sideways

She called me again

As the tune drifted out

She breathed hard through the echo

But the song it was long

And it was far to the end



I glanced at my guitar

And played it pretendin’

That of all the eyes out there

I could see none

As her thoughts pounded hard

Like the pierce of an arrow

But the song it was long

And it had to get done



As the tune finally folded

I laid down the guitar

Then looked for the girl

Who’d stayed for so long

But her shadow was missin’

For all of my searchin’

So I picked up my guitar

And began the next song"

1963,The Freewheelin',Talkin' World War III Blues,"Some time ago a crazy dream came to me
 
 I dreamt I was walkin’ into World War Three
 
 I went to the doctor the very next day
 
 To see what kinda words he could say
 
 He said it was a bad dream
 
 I wouldn’t worry ’bout it none, though
 
 They were my own dreams and they’re only in my head
 
 
 
 I said, “Hold it, Doc, a World War passed through my brain”
 
 He said, “Nurse, get your pad, this boy’s insane”
 
 He grabbed my arm, I said, “Ouch!”
 
 As I landed on the psychiatric couch
 
 He said, “Tell me about it”
 
 
 
 Well, the whole thing started at 3 o’clock fast
 
 It was all over by quarter past
 
 I was down in the sewer with some little lover
 
 When I peeked out from a manhole cover
 
 Wondering who turned the lights on
 
 
 
 Well, I got up and walked around
 
 And up and down the lonesome town
 
 I stood a-wondering which way to go
 
 I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road
 
 It was a normal day
 
 
 
 Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
 
 And I leaned my head and I gave a yell
 
 “Give me a string bean, I’m a hungry man”
 
 A shotgun fired and away I ran
 
 I don’t blame them too much though, I know I look funny
 
 
 
 Down at the corner by a hot-dog stand
 
 I seen a man
 
 I said, “Howdy friend, I guess there’s just us two”
 
 He screamed a bit and away he flew
 
 Thought I was a Communist
 
 
 
 Well, I spied a girl and before she could leave
 
 “Let’s go and play Adam and Eve”
 
 I took her by the hand and my heart it was thumpin’
 
 When she said, “Hey man, you crazy or sumpin’
 
 You see what happened last time they started”
 
 
 
 Well, I seen a Cadillac window uptown
 
 And there was nobody aroun’
 
 I got into the driver’s seat
 
 And I drove down 42nd Street
 
 In my Cadillac. Good car to drive after a war
 
 
 
 Well, I remember seein’ some ad
 
 So I turned on my Conelrad
 
 But I didn’t pay my Con Ed bill
 
 So the radio didn’t work so well
 
 Turned on my record player—
 
 It was Rock-a-day Johnny singin’, “Tell Your Ma, Tell Your Pa
 
 Our Love’s A-gonna Grow Ooh-wah, Ooh-wah”
 
 
 
 I was feelin’ kinda lonesome and blue
 
 I needed somebody to talk to
 
 So I called up the operator of time
 
 Just to hear a voice of some kind
 
 “When you hear the beep it will be three o’clock”
 
 She said that for over an hour
 
 And I hung up
 
 
 
 Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then
 
 Sayin’, “Hey I’ve been havin’ the same old dreams
 
 But mine was a little different you see
 
 I dreamt that the only person left after the war was me
 
 I didn’t see you around”
 
 
 
 Well, now time passed and now it seems
 
 Everybody’s having them dreams
 
 Everybody sees themselves
 
 Walkin’ around with no one else
 
 Half of the people can be part right all of the time
 
 Some of the people can be all right part of the time
 
 But all of the people can’t be all right all of the time
 
 I think Abraham Lincoln said that
 
 “I’ll let you be in my dreams if I can be in yours”
 
 I said that"
1963,The Freewheelin',I Shall Be Free,"Well, I took me a woman late last night
 
 I’s three-fourths drunk, she looked uptight
 
 She took off her wheel, took off her bell
 
 Took off her wig, said, “How do I smell?""
 
 I hot-footed it . . . bare-naked . . .
 
 Out the window!
 
 
 
 Well, sometimes I might get drunk
 
 Walk like a duck and stomp like a skunk
 
 Don’t hurt me none, don’t hurt my pride
 
 ’Cause I got my little lady right by my side
 
 (Right there
 
 Proud as can be)
 
 
 
 I’s out there paintin’ on the old woodshed
 
 When a can a black paint it fell on my head
 
 I went down to scrub and rub
 
 But I had to sit in back of the tub
 
 (Cost a quarter
 
 And I had to get out quick . . .
 
 Someone wanted to come in and take a sauna)
 
 
 
 Well, my telephone rang it would not stop
 
 It’s President Kennedy callin’ me up
 
 He said, “My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?”
 
 I said, “My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot
 
 Anita Ekberg
 
 Sophia Loren”
 
 (Put ’em all in the same room with Ernest Borgnine!)
 
 
 
 Well, I got a woman sleeps on a cot
 
 She yells and hollers and squeals a lot
 
 Licks my face and tickles my ear
 
 Bends me over and buys me beer
 
 (She’s a honeymooner
 
 A June crooner
 
 A spoon feeder
 
 And a natural leader)
 
 
 
 Oh, there ain’t no use in me workin’ so heavy
 
 I got a woman who works on the levee
 
 Pumping that water up to her neck
 
 Every week she sends me a monthly check
 
 (She’s a humdinger
 
 Folk singer
 
 Dead ringer
 
 For a thing-a-muh jigger)
 
 
 
 Late one day in the middle of the week
 
 Eyes were closed I was half asleep
 
 I chased me a woman up the hill
 
 Right in the middle of an air-raid drill
 
 It was Little Bo Peep!
 
 (I jumped a fallout shelter
 
 I jumped a bean stalk
 
 I jumped a Ferris wheel)
 
 
 
 Now, the man on the stand he wants my vote
 
 He’s a-runnin’ for office on the ballot note
 
 He’s out there preachin’ in front of the steeple
 
 Tellin’ me he loves all kinds-a people
 
 (He’s eatin’ bagels
 
 He’s eatin’ pizza
 
 He’s eatin’ chitlins
 
 He’s eatin’ bullshit!)
 
 
 
 Oh, set me down on a television floor
 
 I’ll flip the channel to number four
 
 Out of the shower comes a grown-up man
 
 With a bottle of hair oil in his hand
 
 (It’s that greasy kid stuff
 
 What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is
 
 What do you do about Willy Mays and Yul Brynner
 
 Charles de Gaulle
 
 And Robert Louis Stevenson?)
 
 
 
 Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
 
 Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean
 
 She takes about fifteen baths a day
 
 Wants me to grow a cigar on my face
 
 (She’s a little bit heavy!)
 
 
 
 Well, ask me why I’m drunk alla time
 
 It levels my head and eases my mind
 
 I just walk along and stroll and sing
 
 I see better days and I do better things
 
 (I catch dinosaurs
 
 I make love to Elizabeth Taylor . . .
 
 Catch hell from Richard Burton!)"

 I dreamed a dream that made me sad
 
 Concerning myself and the first few friends I had
 
 
 
 With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
 
 Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon
 
 Where we together weathered many a storm
 
 Laughin’ and singin’ till the early hours of the morn
 
 
 
 By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung
 
 Our words were told, our songs were sung
 
 Where we longed for nothin’ and were quite satisfied
 
 Talkin’ and a-jokin’ about the world outside
 
 
 
 With haunted hearts through the heat and cold
 
 We never thought we could ever get old
 
 We thought we could sit forever in fun
 
 But our chances really was a million to one
 
 
 
 As easy it was to tell black from white
 
 It was all that easy to tell wrong from right
 
 And our choices were few and the thought never hit
 
 That the one road we traveled would ever shatter and split
 
 
 
 How many a year has passed and gone
 
 And many a gamble has been lost and won
 
 And many a road taken by many a friend
 
 And each one I’ve never seen again
 
 
 
 I wish, I wish, I wish in vain
 
 That we could sit simply in that room again
 
 Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat
 
 I’d give it all gladly if our lives could be like that"

1963,"The Bootleg Series, Vol 1-3: Rare & Unreleased 1961-1991",Seven Curses,"Old Reilly stole a stallion

But they caught him and they brought him back

And they laid him down on the jailhouse ground

With an iron chain around his neck



Old Reilly’s daughter got a message

That her father was goin’ to hang

She rode by night and came by morning

With gold and silver in her hand



When the judge he saw Reilly’s daughter

His old eyes deepened in his head

Sayin’, “Gold will never free your father

The price, my dear, is you instead”



“Oh I’m as good as dead,” cried Reilly

“It’s only you that he does crave

And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all

Get on your horse and ride away”



“Oh father you will surely die

If I don’t take the chance to try

And pay the price and not take your advice

For that reason I will have to stay”



The gallows shadows shook the evening

In the night a hound dog bayed

In the night the grounds were groanin’

In the night the price was paid



The next mornin’ she had awoken

To know that the judge had never spoken

She saw that hangin’ branch a-bendin’

She saw her father’s body broken



These be seven curses on a judge so cruel:

That one doctor will not save him

That two healers will not heal him

That three eyes will not see him



That four ears will not hear him

That five walls will not hide him

That six diggers will not bury him

And that seven deaths shall never kill him"

 And the day is a-gettin’ dark
 
 As the night comes in a-fallin’
 
 The dogs’ll lose their bark
 
 An’ the silent night will shatter
 
 From the sounds inside my mind
 
 For I’m one too many mornings
 
 And a thousand miles behind
 
 
 
 From the crossroads of my doorstep
 
 My eyes they start to fade
 
 As I turn my head back to the room
 
 Where my love and I have laid
 
 An’ I gaze back to the street
 
 The sidewalk and the sign
 
 And I’m one too many mornings
 
 An’ a thousand miles behind
 
 
 
 It’s a restless hungry feeling
 
 That don’t mean no one no good
 
 When ev’rything I’m a-sayin’
 
 You can say it just as good.
 
 You’re right from your side
 
 I’m right from mine
 
 We’re both just one too many mornings
 
 An’ a thousand miles behind"
1964,The Times They Are A-Changin',Noth Country Blues,"Come gather ’round friends
 
 And I’ll tell you a tale
 
 Of when the red iron pits ran plenty
 
 But the cardboard filled windows
 
 And old men on the benches
 
 Tell you now that the whole town is empty
 
 
 
 In the north end of town
 
 My own children are grown
 
 But I was raised on the other
 
 In the wee hours of youth
 
 My mother took sick
 
 And I was brought up by my brother
 
 
 
 The iron ore poured
 
 As the years passed the door
 
 The drag lines an’ the shovels they was a-humming
 
 ’Til one day my brother
 
 Failed to come home
 
 The same as my father before him
 
 
 
 Well a long winter’s wait
 
 From the window I watched
 
 My friends they couldn’t have been kinder And my schooling was cut
 
 As I quit in the spring
 
 To marry John Thomas, a miner
 
 
 
 Oh the years passed again
 
 And the givin’ was good
 
 With the lunch bucket filled every season
 
 What with three babies born
 
 The work was cut down
 
 To a half a day’s shift with no reason
 
 
 
 Then the shaft was soon shut
 
 And more work was cut
 
 And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
 
 ’Til a man come to speak
 
 And he said in one week
 
 That number eleven was closin’
 
 
 
 They complained in the East
 
 They are paying too high
 
 They say that your ore ain’t worth digging
 
 That it’s much cheaper down
 
 In the South American towns
 
 Where the miners work almost for nothing
 
 
 
 So the mining gates locked
 
 And the red iron rotted
 
 And the room smelled heavy from drinking
 
 Where the sad, silent song
 
 Made the hour twice as long
 
 As I waited for the sun to go sinking
 
 
 
 I lived by the window
 
 As he talked to himself
 
 This silence of tongues it was building
 
 Then one morning’s wake
 
 The bed it was bare
 
 And I’s left alone with three children
 
 
 
 The summer is gone
 
 The ground’s turning cold
 
 The stores one by one they’re a-foldin’
 
 My children will go
 
 As soon as they grow
 
 Well, there ain’t nothing here now to hold them"
1964,The Times They Are A-Changin',Only a Pawn in Their Game,"A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers’ blood
 
 A finger fired the trigger to his name
 
 A handle hid out in the dark
 
 A hand set the spark
 
 Two eyes took the aim
 
 Behind a man’s brain
 
 But he can’t be blamed
 
 He’s only a pawn in their game
 
 
 
 A South politician preaches to the poor white man
 
 “You got more than the blacks, don’t complain
 
 You’re better than them, you been born with white skin,” they explain.
 
 And the Negro’s name
 
 Is used it is plain
 
 For the politician’s gain
 
 As he rises to fame
 
 And the poor white remains
 
 On the caboose of the train
 
 But it ain’t him to blame
 
 He’s only a pawn in their game
 
 
 
 The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid
 
 And the marshals and cops get the same
 
 But the poor white man’s used in the hands of them all like a tool
 
 He’s taught in his school
 
 From the start by the rule
 
 That the laws are with him
 
 To protect his white skin
 
 To keep up his hate
 
 So he never thinks straight
 
 ’Bout the shape that he’s in
 
 But it ain’t him to blame
 
 He’s only a pawn in their game
 
 
 
 From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
 
 And the hoofbeats pound in his brain
 
 And he’s taught how to walk in a pack
 
 Shoot in the back
 
 With his fist in a clinch
 
 To hang and to lynch
 
 To hide ’neath the hood
 
 To kill with no pain
 
 Like a dog on a chain
 
 He ain’t got no name
 
 But it ain’t him to blame
 
 He’s only a pawn in their game.
 
 
 
 Today, Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught
 
 They lowered him down as a king
 
 But when the shadowy sun sets on the one
 
 That fired the gun
 
 He’ll see by his grave
 
 On the stone that remains
 
 Carved next to his name
 
 His epitaph plain:
 
 Only a pawn in their game"

 And didn’t even talk to the people at the table
 
 Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
 
 And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level
 
 Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
 
 That sailed through the air and came down through the room
 
 Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle

 In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel
 
 To show that all’s equal and that the courts are on the level
 
 And that the strings in the books ain’t pulled and persuaded
 
 And that even the nobles get properly handled
 
 Once that the cops have chased after and caught ’em
 
 And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom
 
 Stared at the person who killed for no reason
 
 Who just happened to be feelin’ that way without warnin’
 
 And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished
 
 And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance

 An’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
 
 
 
 Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail
 
 The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder
 
 That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze
 
 Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder
 
 Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind
 
 Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind
 
 An’ the unpawned painter behind beyond his rightful time
 
 An’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
 
 
 
 Through the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
 
 For the disrobed faceless forms of no position
 
 Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts
 
 All down in taken-for-granted situations
 
 Tolling for the deaf an’ blind, tolling for the mute
 
 Tolling for the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute
 
 For the misdemeanor outlaw, chased an’ cheated by pursuit
 
 An’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
 
 
 
 Even though a cloud’s white curtain in a far-off corner flashed
 
 An’ the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting
 
 Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
 
 Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting
 
 Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail
 
 For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale
 
 An’ for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail
 
 An’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
 
 
 
 Starry-eyed an’ laughing as I recall when we were caught
 
 Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended
 
 As we listened one last time an’ we watched with one last look
 
 Spellbound an’ swallowed ’til the tolling ended
 
 Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed
 
 For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an’ worse
 
 An’ for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe
 
 An’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing"
1964,The Times They Are A-Changin',Restless Farewell,"Oh all the money that in my whole life I did spend
 
 Be it mine right or wrongfully
 
 I let it slip gladly past the hands of my friends
 
 To tie up the time most forcefully
 
 But the bottles are done
 
 We’ve killed each one
 
 And the table’s full and overflowed
 
 And the corner sign
 
 Says it’s closing time
 
 So I’ll bid farewell and be down the road
 
 
 
 Oh ev’ry girl that ever I’ve touched
 
 I did not do it harmfully
 
 And ev’ry girl that ever I’ve hurt
 
 I did not do it knowin’ly
 
 But to remain as friends
 
 And make amends
 
 You need the time and stay behind
 
 And since my feet are now fast
 
 And point away from the past
 
 I’ll bid farewell and be down the line
 
 
 
 Oh ev’ry foe that ever I faced
 
 The cause was there before we came
 
 And ev’ry cause that ever I fought
 
 I fought it full without regret or shame
 
 But the dark does die
 
 As the curtain is drawn and somebody’s eyes
 
 Must meet the dawn
 
 And if I see the day
 
 I’d only have to stay
 
 So I’ll bid farewell in the night and be gone
 
 
 
 Oh, ev’ry thought that’s strung a knot in my mind
 
 I might go insane if it couldn’t be sprung
 
 But it’s not to stand naked under unknowin’ eyes
 
 It’s for myself and my friends my stories are sung
 
 But the time ain’t tall, yet on time you depend
 
 And no word is possessed by no special friend
 
 And though the line is cut
 
 It ain’t quite the end
 
 I’ll just bid farewell till we meet again
 
 
 
 Oh a false clock tries to tick out my time
 
 To disgrace, distract, and bother me
 
 And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
 
 And the dust of rumors covers me
 
 But if the arrow is straight
 
 And the point is slick
 
 It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
 
 So I’ll make my stand
 
 And remain as I am
 
 And bid farewell and not give a damn"

1964,Another Side of Bob Dylan,Spanish Harlem Incident,"Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
 
 Cannot hold you to its heat
 
 Your temperature’s too hot for taming
 
 Your flaming feet burn up the street
 
 I am homeless, come and take me
 
 Into reach of your rattling drums
 
 Let me know, babe, about my fortune
 
 Down along my restless palms
 
 
 
 Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed
 
 I have fallen far beneath
 
 Your pearly eyes, so fast an’ slashing
 
 An’ your flashing diamond teeth

 Pale face fit into place, ah, please!

 On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I’m riding
 
 I know I’m ’round you but I don’t know where
 
 You have slayed me, you have made me
 
 I got to laugh halfways off my heels
 
 I got to know, babe, will you surround me?
 
 So I can tell if I’m really real"
1964,Another Side of Bob Dylan,Ballad in Plain D,"I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze
 
 With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn
 
 I courted her proudly but now she is gone
 
 Gone as the season she’s taken
 
 
 
 Through young summer’s breeze, I stole her away
 
 From her mother and sister, though close did they stay
 
 Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day
 
 With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us
 
 
 
 Of the two sisters, I loved the young
 
 With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one
 
 The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
 
 By the jealousy of others around her
 
 
 
 For her parasite sister, I had no respect
 
 Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect
 
 Countless visions of the other she’d reflect
 
 As a crutch for her scenes and her society
 
 
 
 Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused
 
 The changes I was going through can’t even be used
 
 For the lies that I told her in hopes not to lose
 
 The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime
 
 
 
 With unknown consciousness, I possessed in my grip
 
 A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped
 
 Noticing not that I’d already slipped
 
 To a sin of love’s false security
 
 
 
 From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace
 
 Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
 
 Till the tombstones of damage read me no questions but, “Please
 
 What’s wrong and what’s exactly the matter?”
 
 
 
 And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen
 
 The timeless explosion of fantasy’s dream
 
 At the peak of the night, the king and the queen
 
 Tumbled all down into pieces
 
 
 
 “The tragic figure!” her sister did shout
 
 “Leave her alone, God damn you, get out!”
 
 And I in my armor, turning about
 
 And nailing her to the ruins of her pettiness
 
 
 
 Beneath a bare lightbulb the plaster did pound
 
 Her sister and I in a screaming battleground
 
 And she in between, the victim of sound
 
 Soon shattered as a child ’neath her shadows
 
 
 
 All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight
 
 I gagged twice, doubled, tears blinding my sight
 
 My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night
 
 Leaving all of love’s ashes behind me
 
 
 
 The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet
 
 The words to say I’m sorry, I haven’t found yet
 
 I think of her often and hope whoever she’s met
 
 Will be fully aware of how precious she is
 
 
 
 Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me
 
 “How good, how good does it feel to be free?”
 
 And I answer them most mysteriously
 
 “Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?”"
1964,Another Side of Bob Dylan,I Shall Be Free No. 10,"I’m just average, common too
 
 I’m just like him, the same as you
 
 I’m everybody’s brother and son
 
 I ain’t different from anyone
 
 It ain’t no use a-talking to me
 
 It’s just the same as talking to you
 
 
 
 I was shadow-boxing earlier in the day
 
 I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay
 
 I said “Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come
 
 26, 27, 28, 29, I’m gonna make your face look just like mine
 
 Five, four, three, two, one, Cassius Clay you’d better run
 
 99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won’t even recognize you
 
 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen”
 
 
 
 Well, I don’t know, but I’ve been told
 
 The streets in heaven are lined with gold
 
 I ask you how things could get much worse
 
 If the Russians happen to get up there first
 
 Wowee! pretty scary!
 
 
 
 Now, I’m liberal, but to a degree
 
 I want ev’rybody to be free
 
 But if you think that I’ll let Barry Goldwater
 
 Move in next door and marry my daughter
 
 You must think I’m crazy!
 
 I wouldn’t let him do it for all the farms in Cuba
 
 
 
 Well, I set my monkey on the log
 
 And ordered him to do the Dog
 
 He wagged his tail and shook his head
 
 And he went and did the Cat instead
 
 He’s a weird monkey, very funky
 
 
 
 I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on
 
 Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun
 
 I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
 
 And my wig-hat was falling in my face
 
 But they wouldn’t let me on the tennis court
 
 
 
 I got a woman, she’s so mean
 
 She sticks my boots in the washing machine
 
 Sticks me with buckshot when I’m nude
 
 Puts bubblegum in my food
 
 She’s funny, wants my money, calls me “honey”
 
 
 
 Now I got a friend who spends his life
 
 Stabbing my picture with a bowie knife
 
 Dreams of strangling me with a scarf
 
 When my name comes up he pretends to barf
 
 I’ve got a million friends!
 
 
 
 Now they asked me to read a poem
 
 At the sorority sisters’ home
 
 I got knocked down and my head was swimmin’
 
 I wound up with the Dean of Women
 
 Yippee! I’m a poet, and I know it
 
 Hope I don’t blow it
 
 
 
 I’m gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
 
 So I look like a walking mountain range
 
 And I’m gonna ride into Omaha on a horse
 
 Out to the country club and the golf course
 
 Carry The New York Times, shoot a few holes, blow their minds
 
 
 
 Now you’re probably wondering by now
 
 Just what this song is all about
 
 What’s probably got you baffled more
 
 Is what this thing here is for
 
 It’s nothing
 
 It’s something I learned over in England"
1964,Another Side of Bob Dylan,To Ramona,"Ramona
 
 Come closer
 
 Shut softly your watery eyes
 
 The pangs of your sadness
 
 Shall pass as your senses will rise
 
 The flowers of the city
 
 Though breathlike
 
 Get deathlike at times
 
 And there’s no use in tryin’
 
 T’ deal with the dyin’
 
 Though I cannot explain that in lines
 
 
 
 Your cracked country lips
 
 I still wish to kiss
 
 As to be under the strength of your skin
 
 Your magnetic movements
 
 Still capture the minutes I’m in
 
 But it grieves my heart, love
 
 To see you tryin’ to be a part of
 
 A world that just don’t exist
 
 It’s all just a dream, babe
 
 A vacuum, a scheme, babe
 
 That sucks you into feelin’ like this
 
 
 
 I can see that your head
 
 Has been twisted and fed
 
 By worthless foam from the mouth
 
 I can tell you are torn
 
 Between stayin’ and returnin’
 
 On back to the South
 
 You’ve been fooled into thinking
 
 That the finishin’ end is at hand
 
 Yet there’s no one to beat you
 
 No one t’ defeat you
 
 ’Cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad
 
 
 
 I’ve heard you say many times
 
 That you’re better ’n no one
 
 And no one is better ’n you
 
 If you really believe that
 
 You know you got
 
 Nothing to win and nothing to lose
 
 From fixtures and forces and friends
 
 Your sorrow does stem
 
 That hype you and type you
 
 Making you feel
 
 That you must be exactly like them
 
 
 
 I’d forever talk to you
 
 But soon my words
 
 They would turn into a meaningless ring
 
 For deep in my heart
 
 I know there is no help I can bring
 
 Everything passes
 
 Everything changes
 
 Just do what you think you should do
 
 And someday maybe
 
 Who knows, baby
 
 I’ll come and be cryin’ to you"
1964,Another Side of Bob Dylan,Motorpsycho Nightmare,"I pounded on a farmhouse
 
 Lookin’ for a place to stay
 
 I was mighty, mighty tired
 
 I had come a long, long way
 
 I said, “Hey, hey, in there
 
 Is there anybody home?”
 
 I was standin’ on the steps
 
 Feelin’ most alone
 
 Well, out comes a farmer
 
 He must have thought that I was nuts
 
 He immediately looked at me
 
 And stuck a gun into my guts
 
 
 
 I fell down
 
 To my bended knees
 
 Saying, “I dig farmers
 
 Don’t shoot me, please!”
 
 He cocked his rifle
 
 And began to shout
 
 “You’re that travelin’ salesman
 
 That I have heard about”
 
 I said, “No! No! No!
 
 I’m a doctor and it’s true
 
 I’m a clean-cut kid
 
 And I been to college, too”
 
 
 
 Then in comes his daughter
 
 Whose name was Rita
 
 She looked like she stepped out of
 
 La Dolce Vita
 
 I immediately tried to cool it
 
 With her dad
 
 And told him what a
 
 Nice, pretty farm he had
 
 He said, “What do doctors
 
 Know about farms, pray tell?”
 
 I said, “I was born
 
 At the bottom of a wishing well”
 
 
 
 Well, by the dirt ’neath my nails
 
 I guess he knew I wouldn’t lie
 
 “I guess you’re tired”
 
 He said, kinda sly
 
 I said, “Yes, ten thousand miles
 
 Today I drove”
 
 He said, “I got a bed for you
 
 Underneath the stove
 
 Just one condition
 
 And you go to sleep right now
 
 That you don’t touch my daughter
 
 And in the morning, milk the cow”
 
 
 
 I was sleepin’ like a rat
 
 When I heard something jerkin’
 
 There stood Rita
 
 Lookin’ just like Tony Perkins
 
 She said, “Would you like to take a shower?
 
 I’ll show you up to the door”
 
 I said, “Oh, no! no!
 
 I’ve been through this before”
 
 I knew I had to split
 
 But I didn’t know how
 
 When she said
 
 “Would you like to take that shower, now?”
 
 
 
 Well, I couldn’t leave
 
 Unless the old man chased me out
 
 ’Cause I’d already promised
 
 That I’d milk his cows
 
 I had to say something
 
 To strike him very weird
 
 So I yelled out
 
 “I like Fidel Castro and his beard”
 
 Rita looked offended
 
 But she got out of the way
 
 As he came charging down the stairs
 
 Sayin’, “What’s that I heard you say?”
 
 
 
 I said, “I like Fidel Castro
 
 I think you heard me right”
 
 And ducked as he swung
 
 At me with all his might
 
 Rita mumbled something
 
 ’Bout her mother on the hill
 
 As his fist hit the icebox
 
 He said he’s going to kill me
 
 If I don’t get out the door
 
 In two seconds flat
 
 “You unpatriotic
 
 Rotten doctor Commie rat”
 
 
 
 Well, he threw a Reader’s Digest
 
 At my head and I did run
 
 I did a somersault
 
 As I seen him get his gun
 
 And crashed through the window
 
 At a hundred miles an hour
 
 And landed fully blast
 
 In his garden flowers
 
 Rita said, “Come back!”
 
 As he started to load
 
 The sun was comin’ up
 
 And I was runnin’ down the road
 
 
 
 Well, I don’t figure I’ll be back
 
 There for a spell
 
 Even though Rita moved away
 
 And got a job in a motel
 
 He still waits for me
 
 Constant, on the sly
 
 He wants to turn me in
 
 To the F.B.I.
 
 Me, I romp and stomp
 
 Thankful as I romp
 
 Without freedom of speech
 
 I might be in the swamp"
1964,Another Side of Bob Dylan,I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met),"I can’t understand
 
 She let go of my hand
 
 An’ left me here facing the wall
 
 I’d sure like t’ know
 
 Why she did go
 
 But I can’t get close t’ her at all
 
 Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime
 
 She said she would never forget
 
 But now mornin’s clear
 
 It’s like I ain’t here
 
 She just acts like we never have met
 
 
 
 It’s all new t’ me
 
 Like some mystery
 
 It could even be like a myth
 
 Yet it’s hard t’ think on
 
 That she’s the same one
 
 That last night I was with
 
 From darkness, dreams’re deserted
 
 Am I still dreamin’ yet?
 
 I wish she’d unlock
 
 Her voice once an’ talk
 
 ’Stead of acting like we never have met
 
 
 
 If she ain’t feelin’ well
 
 Then why don’t she tell
 
 ’Stead of turnin’ her back t’ my face?
 
 Without any doubt
 
 She seems too far out
 
 For me t’ return t’ her chase
 
 Though the night ran swirling an’ whirling
 
 I remember her whispering yet
 
 But evidently she don’t
 
 An’ evidently she won’t
 
 She just acts like we never have met
 
 
 
 If I didn’t have t’ guess
 
 I’d gladly confess
 
 T’ anything I might’ve tried
 
 If I was with ’er too long
 
 Or have done something wrong
 
 I wish she’d tell me what it is, I’ll run an’ hide
 
 Though her skirt it swayed as a guitar played
 
 Her mouth was watery and wet
 
 But now something has changed
 
 For she ain’t the same
 
 She just acts like we never have met
 
 
 
 I’m leavin’ today
 
 I’ll be on my way
 
 Of this I can’t say very much
 
 But if you want me to
 
 I can be just like you
 
 An’ pretend that we never have touched
 
 An’ if anybody asks me
 
 “Is it easy to forget?”
 
 I’ll say, “It’s easily done
 
 You just pick anyone
 
 An’ pretend that you never have met!”"

 The cloak and dagger dangles
 
 Madams light the candles
 
 In ceremonies of the horsemen
 
 Even the pawn must hold a grudge
 
 Statues made of matchsticks
 
 Crumble into one another
 
 My love winks, she does not bother
 
 She knows too much to argue or to judge
 
 
 
 The bridge at midnight trembles
 
 The country doctor rambles
 
 Bankers’ nieces seek perfection
 
 Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring
 
 The wind howls like a hammer
 
 The night blows cold and rainy
 
 My love she’s like some raven
 
 At my window with a broken wing"
1965,Bringing It All Back Home,She Belongs to Me,"She’s got everything she needs
 
 She’s an artist, she don’t look back
 
 She’s got everything she needs
 
 She’s an artist, she don’t look back
 
 She can take the dark out of the nighttime
 
 And paint the daytime black
 
 
 
 You will start out standing
 
 Proud to steal her anything she sees
 
 You will start out standing
 
 Proud to steal her anything she sees
 
 But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole
 
 Down upon your knees
 
 
 
 She never stumbles
 
 She’s got no place to fall
 
 She never stumbles
 
 She’s got no place to fall
 
 She’s nobody’s child
 
 The Law can’t touch her at all
 
 
 
 She wears an Egyptian ring
 
 That sparkles before she speaks
 
 She wears an Egyptian ring
 
 That sparkles before she speaks
 
 She’s a hypnotist collector
 
 You are a walking antique
 
 
 
 Bow down to her on Sunday
 
 Salute her when her birthday comes
 
 Bow down to her on Sunday
 
 Salute her when her birthday comes
 
 For Halloween give her a trumpet
 
 And for Christmas, buy her a drum"
1965,Bringing It All Back Home,Subterranean Homesick Blues,"Johnny’s in the basement
 
 Mixing up the medicine
 
 I’m on the pavement
 
 Thinking about the government
 
 The man in the trench coat
 
 Badge out, laid off
 
 Says he’s got a bad cough
 
 Wants to get it paid off
 
 Look out kid
 
 It’s somethin’ you did
 
 God knows when
 
 But you’re doin’ it again
 
 You better duck down the alley way
 
 Lookin’ for a new friend
 
 The man in the coon-skin cap
 
 By the big pen
 
 Wants eleven dollar bills
 
 You only got ten
 
 
 
 Maggie comes fleet foot
 
 Face full of black soot
 
 Talkin’ that the heat put
 
 Plants in the bed but
 
 The phone’s tapped anyway
 
 Maggie says that many say
 
 They must bust in early May
 
 Orders from the D.A.
 
 Look out kid
 
 Don’t matter what you did
 
 Walk on your tiptoes
 
 Don’t try “No-Doz”
 
 Better stay away from those
 
 That carry around a fire hose
 
 Keep a clean nose
 
 Watch the plain clothes
 
 You don’t need a weatherman
 
 To know which way the wind blows
 
 
 
 Get sick, get well
 
 Hang around a ink well
 
 Ring bell, hard to tell
 
 If anything is goin’ to sell
 
 Try hard, get barred
 
 Get back, write braille
 
 Get jailed, jump bail
 
 Join the army, if you fail
 
 Look out kid
 
 You’re gonna get hit
 
 But users, cheaters
 
 Six-time losers
 
 Hang around the theaters
 
 Girl by the whirlpool
 
 Lookin’ for a new fool
 
 Don’t follow leaders
 
 Watch the parkin’ meters
 
 
 
 Ah get born, keep warm
 
 Short pants, romance, learn to dance
 
 Get dressed, get blessed
 
 Try to be a success
 
 Please her, please him, buy gifts
 
 Don’t steal, don’t lift
 
 Twenty years of schoolin’
 
 And they put you on the day shift
 
 Look out kid
 
 They keep it all hid
 
 Better jump down a manhole
 
 Light yourself a candle
 
 Don’t wear sandals
 
 Try to avoid the scandals
 
 Don’t wanna be a bum
 
 You better chew gum
 
 The pump don’t work
 
 ’Cause the vandals took the handles"
1965,Highway 61 Revisited,Destolatian Row,"They’re selling postcards of the hanging
 
 They’re painting the passports brown
 
 The beauty parlor is filled with sailors
 
 The circus is in town
 
 Here comes the blind commissioner
 
 They’ve got him in a trance
 
 One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
 
 The other is in his pants
 
 And the riot squad they’re restless
 
 They need somewhere to go
 
 As Lady and I look out tonight
 
 From Desolation Row
 
 
 
 Cinderella, she seems so easy
 
 “It takes one to know one,” she smiles
 
 And puts her hands in her back pockets
 
 Bette Davis style
 
 And in comes Romeo, he’s moaning
 
 “You Belong to Me I Believe”
 
 And someone says, “You’re in the wrong place my friend
 
 You better leave”
 
 And the only sound that’s left
 
 After the ambulances go
 
 Is Cinderella sweeping up
 
 On Desolation Row
 
 
 
 Now the moon is almost hidden
 
 The stars are beginning to hide
 
 The fortune-telling lady
 
 Has even taken all her things inside
 
 All except for Cain and Abel
 
 And the hunchback of Notre Dame
 
 Everybody is making love
 
 Or else expecting rain
 
 And the Good Samaritan, he’s dressing
 
 He’s getting ready for the show
 
 He’s going to the carnival tonight
 
 On Desolation Row
 
 
 
 Now Ophelia, she’s ’neath the window
 
 For her I feel so afraid
 
 On her twenty-second birthday
 
 She already is an old maid
 
 To her, death is quite romantic
 
 She wears an iron vest
 
 Her profession’s her religion
 
 Her sin is her lifelessness
 
 And though her eyes are fixed upon
 
 Noah’s great rainbow
 
 She spends her time peeking
 
 Into Desolation Row
 
 
 
 Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood
 
 With his memories in a trunk
 
 Passed this way an hour ago
 
 With his friend, a jealous monk
 
 He looked so immaculately frightful
 
 As he bummed a cigarette
 
 Then he went off sniffing drainpipes
 
 And reciting the alphabet
 
 Now you would not think to look at him
 
 But he was famous long ago
 
 For playing the electric violin
 
 On Desolation Row
 
 
 
 Dr. Filth, he keeps his world
 
 Inside of a leather cup
 
 But all his sexless patients
 
 They’re trying to blow it up
 
 Now his nurse, some local loser
 
 She’s in charge of the cyanide hole
 
 And she also keeps the cards that read
 
 “Have Mercy on His Soul”
 
 They all play on pennywhistles
 
 You can hear them blow
 
 If you lean your head out far enough
 
 From Desolation Row
 
 
 
 Across the street they’ve nailed the curtains
 
 They’re getting ready for the feast
 
 The Phantom of the Opera
 
 A perfect image of a priest
 
 They’re spoonfeeding Casanova
 
 To get him to feel more assured
 
 Then they’ll kill him with self-confidence
 
 After poisoning him with words
 
 And the Phantom’s shouting to skinny girls
 
 “Get Outa Here If You Don’t Know
 
 Casanova is just being punished for going
 
 To Desolation Row”
 
 
 
 Now at midnight all the agents
 
 And the superhuman crew
 
 Come out and round up everyone
 
 That knows more than they do
 
 Then they bring them to the factory
 
 Where the heart-attack machine
 
 Is strapped across their shoulders
 
 And then the kerosene
 
 Is brought down from the castles
 
 By insurance men who go
 
 Check to see that nobody is escaping
 
 To Desolation Row
 
 
 
 Praise be to Nero’s Neptune
 
 The Titanic sails at dawn
 
 And everybody’s shouting
 
 “Which Side Are You On?”
 
 And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot
 
 Fighting in the captain’s tower
 
 While calypso singers laugh at them
 
 And fishermen hold flowers
 
 Between the windows of the sea
 
 Where lovely mermaids flow
 
 And nobody has to think too much
 
 About Desolation Row
 
 
 
 Yes, I received your letter yesterday
 
 (About the time the doorknob broke)
 
 When you asked how I was doing
 
 Was that some kind of joke?
 
 All these people that you mention
 
 Yes, I know them, they’re quite lame
 
 I had to rearrange their faces
 
 And give them all another name
 
 Right now I can’t read too good
 
 Don’t send me no more letters no
 
 Not unless you mail them
 
 From Desolation Row"
1965,Highway 61 Revisited,From a Buick 6,"I got this graveyard woman, you know she keeps my kid
 
 But my soulful mama, you know she keeps me hid
 
 She’s a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread
 
 Well, if I go down dyin’, you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
 
 
 
 Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I’m lost on the river bridge
 
 I’m cracked up on the highway and on the water’s edge
 
 She comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with thread
 
 Well, if I go down dyin’, you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
 
 
 
 Well, she don’t make me nervous, she don’t talk too much
 
 She walks like Bo Diddley and she don’t need no crutch
 
 She keeps this four-ten all loaded with lead
 
 Well, if I go down dyin’, you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
 
 
 
 Well, you know I need a steam shovel mama to keep away the dead
 
 I need a dump truck mama to unload my head
 
 She brings me everything and more, and just like I said
 
 Well, if I go down dyin’, you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed."

I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents

See my hound dog bite a rabbit

And my football’s sittin’ on a barbed-wire fence



Well, my temperature rises and my feet don’t walk so fast

Yes, my temperature rises and my feet don’t walk so fast

Well, this Arabian doctor came in, gave me a shot

But wouldn’t tell me if what I had would last



Well, this woman I’ve got, she’s filling me with her drive

Yes, this woman I’ve got, she’s thrillin’ me with her hive

She’s calling me Stan

Or else she calls me Mister Clive



Of course, you’re gonna think this song is a riff

I know you’re gonna think this song is a cliff

Unless you’ve been inside a tunnel

And fell down 69, 70 feet over a barbed-wire fence

The bells of the crown

Are being stolen by bandits

I must follow the sound

The triangle tingles

And the trumpets play slow

Farewell Angelina

The sky is on fire

And I must go



There’s no need for anger

There’s no need for blame

There’s nothing to prove

Ev’rything’s still the same

Just a table standing empty

By the edge of the sea

Farewell Angelina

The sky is trembling

And I must leave



The jacks and the queens

Have forsaked the courtyard

Fifty-two gypsies

Now file past the guards

In the space where the deuce

And the ace once ran wild

Farewell Angelina

The sky is folding

I’ll see you in a while



See the cross-eyed pirates sitting

Perched in the sun

Shooting tin cans

With a sawed-off shotgun

And the neighbors they clap

And they cheer with each blast

Farewell Angelina

The sky’s changing color

And I must leave fast



King Kong, little elves

On the rooftops they dance

Valentino-type tangos

While the makeup man’s hands

Shut the eyes of the dead

Not to embarrass anyone

Farewell Angelina

The sky is embarrassed

And I must be gone



The machine guns are roaring

The puppets heave rocks

The fiends nail time bombs

To the hands of the clocks

Call me any name you like

I will never deny it

Farewell Angelina

The sky is erupting

I must go where it’s quiet"
1965,Highway 61 Revisited,Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues,"When you’re lost in the rain in Juarez
 
 And it’s Eastertime too
 
 And your gravity fails
 
 And negativity don’t pull you through
 
 Don’t put on any airs
 
 When you’re down on Rue Morgue Avenue
 
 They got some hungry women there
 
 And they really make a mess outta you
 
 
 
 Now if you see Saint Annie
 
 Please tell her thanks a lot
 
 I cannot move
 
 My fingers are all in a knot
 
 I don’t have the strength
 
 To get up and take another shot
 
 And my best friend, my doctor
 
 Won’t even say what it is I’ve got
 
 
 
 Sweet Melinda
 
 The peasants call her the goddess of gloom
 
 She speaks good English
 
 And she invites you up into her room
 
 And you’re so kind
 
 And careful not to go to her too soon
 
 And she takes your voice
 
 And leaves you howling at the moon
 
 
 
 Up on Housing Project Hill
 
 It’s either fortune or fame
 
 You must pick up one or the other
 
 Though neither of them are to be what they claim
 
 If you’re lookin’ to get silly
 
 You better go back to from where you came
 
 Because the cops don’t need you
 
 And man they expect the same
 
 
 
 Now all the authorities
 
 They just stand around and boast
 
 How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms
 
 Into leaving his post
 
 And picking up Angel who
 
 Just arrived here from the coast
 
 Who looked so fine at first
 
 But left looking just like a ghost
 
 
 
 I started out on burgundy
 
 But soon hit the harder stuff
 
 Everybody said they’d stand behind me
 
 When the game got rough
 
 But the joke was on me
 
 There was nobody even there to call my bluff
 
 I’m going back to New York City
 
 I do believe I’ve had enough"

 Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
 
 In the jingle jangle morning I’ll come followin’ you
 
 
 
 Though I know that evenin’s empire has returned into sand
 
 Vanished from my hand
 
 Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping
 
 My weariness amazes me, I’m branded on my feet
 
 I have no one to meet
 
 And the ancient empty street’s too dead for dreaming

 Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin’ ship
 
 My senses have been stripped, my hands can’t feel to grip
 
 My toes too numb to step
 
 Wait only for my boot heels to be wanderin’
 
 I’m ready to go anywhere, I’m ready for to fade
 
 Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way
 
 I promise to go under it

 And but for the sky there are no fences facin’
 
 And if you hear vague traces of skippin’ reels of rhyme

 I wouldn’t pay it any mind
 
 It’s just a shadow you’re seein’ that he’s chasing

 Then take me disappearin’ through the smoke rings of my mind
 
 Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
 
 The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach
 
 Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
 
 Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
 
 Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
 
 With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
 
 Let me forget about today until tomorrow

 And your father to your sister he explains
 
 That you’re tired of yourself and all of your creations
 
 Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
 
 Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
 
 
 
 Now when all of the flower ladies want back what they have lent you
 
 And the smell of their roses does not remain
 
 And all of your children start to resent you

 Have died in battle or in vain
 
 And you’re sick of all this repetition
 
 Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
 
 Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
 
 
 
 When all of your advisers heave their plastic
 
 At your feet to convince you of your pain
 
 Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic
 
 Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
 
 Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
 
 
 
 Now when all the bandits that you turned your other cheek to

1965,Bringing It All Back Home,Gates of Eden,"Of war and peace the truth just twists
 
 Its curfew gull just glides
 
 Upon four-legged forest clouds
 
 The cowboy angel rides
 
 With his candle lit into the sun
 
 Though its glow is waxed in black
 
 All except when ’neath the trees of Eden
 
 
 
 The lamppost stands with folded arms
 
 Its iron claws attached
 
 To curbs ’neath holes where babies wail
 
 Though it shadows metal badge
 
 All and all can only fall
 
 With a crashing but meaningless blow
 
 No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden
 
 
 
 The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
 
 And then complains
 
 Unto the shoeless hunter who’s gone deaf
 
 But still remains
 
 Upon the beach where hound dogs bay
 
 At ships with tattooed sails
 
 Heading for the Gates of Eden
 
 
 
 With a time-rusted compass blade
 
 Aladdin and his lamp
 
 Sits with Utopian hermit monks
 
 Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf
 
 And on their promises of paradise
 
 You will not hear a laugh
 
 All except inside the Gates of Eden
 
 
 
 Relationships of ownership
 
 They whisper in the wings
 
 To those condemned to act accordingly
 
 And wait for succeeding kings
 
 And I try to harmonize with songs
 
 The lonesome sparrow sings
 
 There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden
 
 
 
 The motorcycle black madonna
 
 Two-wheeled gypsy queen
 
 And her silver-studded phantom cause
 
 The gray flannel dwarf to scream
 
 As he weeps to wicked birds of prey
 
 Who pick up on his bread crumb sins
 
 And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden
 
 
 
 The kingdoms of Experience
 
 In the precious wind they rot
 
 While paupers change possessions
 
 Each one wishing for what the other has got
 
 And the princess and the prince
 
 Discuss what’s real and what is not
 
 It doesn’t matter inside the Gates of Eden
 
 
 
 The foreign sun, it squints upon
 
 A bed that is never mine
 
 As friends and other strangers
 
 From their fates try to resign
 
 Leaving men wholly, totally free
 
 To do anything they wish to do but die
 
 And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden
 
 
 
 At dawn my lover comes to me
 
 And tells me of her dreams
 
 With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
 
 Into the ditch of what each one means
 
 At times I think there are no words
 
 But these to tell what’s true
 
 And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden"
1965,Bringing It All Back Home,"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)","Darkness at the break of noon
 
 Shadows even the silver spoon
 
 The handmade blade, the child’s balloon
 
 Eclipses both the sun and moon
 
 To understand you know too soon
 
 There is no sense in trying
 
 
 
 Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
 
 Suicide remarks are torn
 
 From the fool’s gold mouthpiece the hollow horn
 
 Plays wasted words, proves to warn
 
 That he not busy being born is busy dying
 
 
 
 Temptation’s page flies out the door
 
 You follow, find yourself at war
 
 Watch waterfalls of pity roar
 
 You feel to moan but unlike before
 
 You discover that you’d just be one more
 
 Person crying
 
 
 
 So don’t fear if you hear
 
 A foreign sound to your ear
 
 It’s alright, Ma, I’m only sighing
 
 
 
 As some warn victory, some downfall
 
 Private reasons great or small
 
 Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
 
 To make all that should be killed to crawl
 
 While others say don’t hate nothing at all
 
 Except hatred
 
 
 
 Disillusioned words like bullets bark
 
 As human gods aim for their mark
 
 Make everything from toy guns that spark
 
 To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark
 
 It’s easy to see without looking too far
 
 That not much is really sacred
 
 
 
 While preachers preach of evil fates
 
 Teachers teach that knowledge waits
 
 Can lead to hundred-dollar plates
 
 Goodness hides behind its gates
 
 But even the president of the United States
 
 Sometimes must have to stand naked
 
 
 
 An’ though the rules of the road have been lodged
 
 It’s only people’s games that you got to dodge
 
 And it’s alright, Ma, I can make it
 
 
 
 Advertising signs they con
 
 You into thinking you’re the one
 
 That can do what’s never been done
 
 That can win what’s never been won
 
 Meantime life outside goes on
 
 All around you
 
 
 
 You lose yourself, you reappear
 
 You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
 
 Alone you stand with nobody near
 
 When a trembling distant voice, unclear
 
 Startles your sleeping ears to hear
 
 That somebody thinks they really found you
 
 
 
 A question in your nerves is lit
 
 Yet you know there is no answer fit
 
 To satisfy, insure you not to quit
 
 To keep it in your mind and not forget
 
 That it is not he or she or them or it
 
 That you belong to
 
 
 
 Although the masters make the rules
 
 For the wise men and the fools
 
 I got nothing, Ma, to live up to
 
 
 
 For them that must obey authority
 
 That they do not respect in any degree
 
 Who despise their jobs, their destinies
 
 Speak jealously of them that are free
 
 Cultivate their flowers to be
 
 Nothing more than something they invest in
 
 
 
 While some on principles baptized
 
 To strict party platform ties
 
 Social clubs in drag disguise
 
 Outsiders they can freely criticize
 
 Tell nothing except who to idolize
 
 And then say God bless him
 
 
 
 While one who sings with his tongue on fire
 
 Gargles in the rat race choir
 
 Bent out of shape from society’s pliers
 
 Cares not to come up any higher
 
 But rather get you down in the hole
 
 That he’s in
 
 
 
 But I mean no harm nor put fault
 
 On anyone that lives in a vault
 
 But it’s alright, Ma, if I can’t please him
 
 
 
 Old lady judges watch people in pairs
 
 Limited in sex, they dare
 
 To push fake morals, insult and stare
 
 While money doesn’t talk, it swears
 
 Obscenity, who really cares
 
 Propaganda, all is phony
 
 
 
 While them that defend what they cannot see
 
 With a killer’s pride, security
 
 It blows the minds most bitterly
 
 For them that think death’s honesty
 
 Won’t fall upon them naturally
 
 Life sometimes must get lonely
 
 
 
 My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
 
 Graveyards, false gods, I scuff
 
 At pettiness which plays so rough
 
 Walk upside-down inside handcuffs
 
 Kick my legs to crash it off
 
 Say okay, I have had enough
 
 what else can you show me?
 
 
 
 And if my thought-dreams could be seen
 
 They’d probably put my head in a guillotine
 
 But it’s alright, Ma, it’s life, and life only"

 Well, I asked for something to eat
 
 I’m hungry as a hog
 
 So I get brown rice, seaweed
 
 And a dirty hot dog
 
 I’ve got a hole
 
 Where my stomach disappeared
 
 Then you ask why I don’t live here
 
 Honey, I gotta think you’re really weird
 
 
 
 Your grandpa’s cane
 
 It turns into a sword
 
 Your grandma prays to pictures
 
 That are pasted on a board
 
 Everything inside my pockets
 
 Your uncle steals
 
 Then you ask why I don’t live here
 
 Honey, I can’t believe that you’re for real
 
 
 
 Well, there’s fistfights in the kitchen
 
 They’re enough to make me cry
 
 The mailman comes in
 
 Even he’s gotta take a side
 
 Even the butler
 
 He’s got something to prove
 
 Then you ask why I don’t live here
 
 Honey, how come you don’t move?"

 On top of the hill
 
 And if I don’t make it
 
 You know my baby will
 
 
 
 Don’t the moon look good, mama
 
 Shinin’ through the trees?
 
 Don’t the brakeman look good, mama
 
 Flagging down the “Double E?”
 
 Don’t the sun look good
 
 Goin’ down over the sea?
 
 Don’t my gal look fine
 
 When she’s comin’ after me?

1965,Highway 61 Revisited,Like a Rolling Stone,"Once upon a time you dressed so fine
 
 You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn’t you?
 
 People’d call, say, “Beware doll, you’re bound to fall”
 
 You thought they were all kiddin’ you
 
 You used to laugh about
 
 Everybody that was hangin’ out
 
 Now you don’t talk so loud
 
 Now you don’t seem so proud
 
 About having to be scrounging for your next meal
 
 
 
 How does it feel
 
 How does it feel
 
 To be without a home
 
 Like a complete unknown
 
 Like a rolling stone?
 
 
 
 You’ve gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
 
 But you know you only used to get juiced in it
 
 And nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street
 
 And now you find out you’re gonna have to get used to it
 
 You said you’d never compromise
 
 With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
 
 He’s not selling any alibis
 
 As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
 
 And ask him do you want to make a deal?
 
 
 
 How does it feel
 
 How does it feel
 
 To be on your own
 
 With no direction home
 
 Like a complete unknown
 
 Like a rolling stone?
 
 
 
 You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns
 
 When they all come down and did tricks for you
 
 You never understood that it ain’t no good
 
 You shouldn’t let other people get your kicks for you
 
 You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
 
 Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
 
 Ain’t it hard when you discover that
 
 He really wasn’t where it’s at
 
 After he took from you everything he could steal
 
 
 
 How does it feel
 
 How does it feel
 
 To be on your own
 
 With no direction home
 
 Like a complete unknown
 
 Like a rolling stone?
 
 
 
 Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
 
 They’re drinkin’, thinkin’ that they got it made
 
 Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things
 
 But you’d better lift your diamond ring, you’d better pawn it babe
 
 You used to be so amused
 
 At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
 
 Go to him now, he calls you, you can’t refuse
 
 When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose
 
 You’re invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal
 
 
 
 How does it feel
 
 How does it feel
 
 To be on your own
 
 With no direction home

1965,Bringing It All Back Home,"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue","You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last
 
 But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
 
 Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
 
 Crying like a fire in the sun
 
 Look out the saints are comin’ through
 
 And it’s all over now, Baby Blue
 
 
 
 The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
 
 Take what you have gathered from coincidence
 
 The empty-handed painter from your streets
 
 Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
 
 This sky, too, is folding under you
 
 And it’s all over now, Baby Blue
 
 
 
 All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
 
 All your reindeer armies, are all going home
 
 The lover who just walked out your door
 
 Has taken all his blankets from the floor
 
 The carpet, too, is moving under you
 
 And it’s all over now, Baby Blue
 
 
 
 Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you
 
 Forget the dead you’ve left, they will not follow you
 
 The vagabond who’s rapping at your door
 
 Is standing in the clothes that you once wore
 
 Strike another match, go start anew
 
 And it’s all over now, Baby Blue"
1965,Bringing It All Back Home,Bob Dylan's 115th Deam,"I was riding on the Mayflower
 
 When I thought I spied some land
 
 I yelled for Captain Arab
 
 I have yuh understand
 
 Who came running to the deck
 
 Said, “Boys, forget the whale
 
 Look on over yonder
 
 Cut the engines
 
 Change the sail
 
 Haul on the bowline”
 
 We sang that melody
 
 Like all tough sailors do
 
 When they are far away at sea
 
 
 
 “I think I’ll call it America”
 
 I said as we hit land
 
 I took a deep breath
 
 I fell down, I could not stand
 
 Captain Arab he started
 
 Writing up some deeds
 
 He said, “Let’s set up a fort
 
 And start buying the place with beads”
 
 Just then this cop comes down the street
 
 Crazy as a loon
 
 He throw us all in jail
 
 For carryin’ harpoons
 
 
 
 Ah me I busted out
 
 Don’t even ask me how
 
 I went to get some help
 
 I walked by a Guernsey cow
 
 Who directed me down
 
 To the Bowery slums
 
 Where people carried signs around
 
 Saying, “Ban the bums”
 
 I jumped right into line
 
 Sayin’, “I hope that I’m not late”
 
 When I realized I hadn’t eaten
 
 For five days straight
 
 
 
 I went into a restaurant
 
 Lookin’ for the cook
 
 I told them I was the editor
 
 Of a famous etiquette book
 
 The waitress he was handsome
 
 He wore a powder blue cape
 
 I ordered some suzette, I said
 
 “Could you please make that crepe”
 
 Just then the whole kitchen exploded
 
 From boilin’ fat
 
 Food was flying everywhere
 
 And I left without my hat
 
 
 
 Now, I didn’t mean to be nosy
 
 But I went into a bank
 
 To get some bail for Arab
 
 And all the boys back in the tank
 
 They asked me for some collateral
 
 And I pulled down my pants
 
 They threw me in the alley
 
 When up comes this girl from France
 
 Who invited me to her house
 
 I went, but she had a friend
 
 Who knocked me out
 
 And robbed my boots
 
 And I was on the street again
 
 
 
 Well, I rapped upon a house
 
 With the U.S. flag upon display
 
 I said, “Could you help me out
 
 I got some friends down the way”
 
 The man says, “Get out of here
 
 I’ll tear you limb from limb”
 
 I said, “You know they refused Jesus, too”
 
 He said, “You’re not Him
 
 Get out of here before I break your bones
 
 I ain’t your pop”
 
 I decided to have him arrested
 
 And I went looking for a cop
 
 
 
 I ran right outside
 
 And I hopped inside a cab
 
 I went out the other door
 
 This Englishman said, “Fab”
 
 As he saw me leap a hot dog stand
 
 And a chariot that stood
 
 Parked across from a building
 
 Advertising brotherhood
 
 I ran right through the front door
 
 Like a hobo sailor does
 
 But it was just a funeral parlor
 
 And the man asked me who I was
 
 
 
 I repeated that my friends
 
 Were all in jail, with a sigh
 
 He gave me his card
 
 He said, “Call me if they die”
 
 I shook his hand and said goodbye
 
 Ran out to the street
 
 When a bowling ball came down the road
 
 And knocked me off my feet
 
 A pay phone was ringing
 
 It just about blew my mind
 
 When I picked it up and said hello
 
 This foot came through the line
 
 
 
 Well, by this time I was fed up
 
 At tryin’ to make a stab
 
 At bringin’ back any help
 
 For my friends and Captain Arab
 
 I decided to flip a coin
 
 Like either heads or tails
 
 Would let me know if I should go
 
 Back to ship or back to jail
 
 So I hocked my sailor suit
 
 And I got a coin to flip
 
 It came up tails
 
 It rhymed with sails
 
 So I made it back to the ship
 
 
 
 
 
 Well, I got back and took
 
 The parkin’ ticket off the mast
 
 I was ripping it to shreds
 
 When this coastguard boat went past
 
 They asked me my name
 
 And I said, “Captain Kidd”
 
 They believed me but
 
 They wanted to know
 
 What exactly that I did
 
 I said for the Pope of Eruke
 
 I was employed
 
 They let me go right away
 
 They were very paranoid
 
 
 
 Well, the last I heard of Arab
 
 He was stuck on a whale
 
 That was married to the deputy
 
 Sheriff of the jail
 
 But the funniest thing was
 
 When I was leavin’ the bay
 
 I saw three ships a-sailin’
 
 They were all heading my way
 
 I asked the captain what his name was
 
 And how come he didn’t drive a truck
 
 He said his name was Columbus
 
 I just said, “Good luck”"

 I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s ma no more
 
 No, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s ma no more

 About man and God and law

 She’s sixty-eight, but she says she’s twenty-four

 I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more
 
 No, I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more

 To be just like them

1966,Blonde on Blonde,Fourth Time Around,"When she said
 
 “Don’t waste your words, they’re just lies”
 
 I cried she was deaf
 
 And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes
 
 Then said, “What else you got left?”
 
 It was then that I got up to leave
 
 But she said, “Don’t forget
 
 Everybody must give something back
 
 For something they get”
 
 
 
 I stood there and hummed
 
 I tapped on her drum and asked her how come
 
 And she buttoned her boot
 
 And straightened her suit
 
 Then she said, “Don’t get cute”
 
 So I forced my hands in my pockets
 
 And felt with my thumbs
 
 And gallantly handed her
 
 My very last piece of gum
 
 
 
 She threw me outside
 
 I stood in the dirt where ev’ryone walked
 
 And after finding I’d
 
 Forgotten my shirt
 
 I went back and knocked
 
 I waited in the hallway, she went to get it
 
 And I tried to make sense
 
 Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair
 
 That leaned up against . . .
 
 
 
 Her Jamaican rum
 
 And when she did come, I asked her for some
 
 She said, “No, dear”
 
 I said, “Your words aren’t clear
 
 You’d better spit out your gum”
 
 She screamed till her face got so red
 
 Then she fell on the floor
 
 And I covered her up and then
 
 Thought I’d go look through her drawer
 
 
 
 And when I was through
 
 I filled up my shoe
 
 And brought it to you
 
 And you, you took me in
 
 You loved me then
 
 You didn’t waste time
 
 And I, I never took much
 
 I never asked for your crutch
 
 Now don’t ask for mine"

Also, so, so did the landlord

The scene was so crazy, wasn’t it?

Both were so glad

To watch me destroy what I had

Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn’t it?

Why didn’t you just leave me if you didn’t want to stay?

Why’d you have to treat me so bad?

Did it have to be that way?

Now you stand here expectin’ me to remember somethin’ you forgot to say

Yes, and you, I see you’re still with her, well

That’s fine ’cause she’s comin’ on so strange, can’t you tell?

Somebody had better explain

She’s got her iron chain

I’d do it, but I, I just can’t remember how

You talk to her

She’s your lover now



I already assumed

That we’re in the felony room

But I ain’t a judge, you don’t have to be nice to me

But please tell that

To your friend in the cowboy hat

You know he keeps on sayin’ ev’rythin’ twice to me

You know I was straight with you

You know I’ve never tried to change you in any way

You know if you didn’t want to be with me

That you could . . . didn’t have to stay

Now you stand here sayin’ you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?

Yes, you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays, can’t you reach?

I see you kiss her on the cheek ev’rytime she gives a speech

With her picture books of the pyramid

And her postcards of Billy the Kid (why must everybody bow?)

You better talk to her ’bout it

You’re her lover now



Oh, ev’rybody that cares

Is goin’ up the castle stairs

But I’m not up in your castle, honey

It’s true, I just can’t recall

San Francisco at all

I can’t even remember El Paso, uh, honey

You never had to be faithful

I didn’t want you to grieve

Oh, why was it so hard for you

If you didn’t want to be with me, just to leave?

Now you stand here while your finger’s goin’ up my sleeve

An’ you, just what do you do anyway? Ain’t there nothin’ you can say?

She’ll be standin’ on the bar soon

With a fish head an’ a harpoon

An’ a fake beard plastered on her brow

You’d better do somethin’ quick

 To show you the dead angels that they used to hide
 
 But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
 
 Oh, how could they ever mistake you?
 
 They wished you’d accepted the blame for the farm
 
 But with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
 
 And with the child of a hoodlum wrapped up in your arms
 
 How could they ever, ever persuade you?
 
 Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
 
 Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes
 
 My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
 
 Should I leave them by your gate
 
 Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
 
 
 
 With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
 
 And your magazine-husband who one day just had to go
 
 And your gentleness now, which you just can’t help but show
 
 Who among them do you think would employ you?
 
 Now you stand with your thief, you’re on his parole
 
 With your holy medallion which your fingertips fold
 
 And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul
 
 Oh, who among them do you think could destroy you?
 
 Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
 
 Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes
 
 My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
 
 Should I leave them by your gate
 
 Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?"
1966,Blonde on Blonde,Temporary Like Achilles,"Standing on your window, honey
 
 Yes, I’ve been here before
 
 Feeling so harmless
 
 I’m looking at your second door
 
 How come you don’t send me no regards?
 
 You know I want your lovin’
 
 Honey, why are you so hard?
 
 
 
 Kneeling ’neath your ceiling
 
 Yes, I guess I’ll be here for a while
 
 I’m tryin’ to read your portrait, but
 
 I’m helpless, like a rich man’s child
 
 How come you send someone out to have me barred?
 
 You know I want your lovin’
 
 Honey, why are you so hard?
 
 
 
 Like a poor fool in his prime
 
 Yes, I know you can hear me walk
 
 But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime
 
 Or is it just solid rock?
 
 
 
 Well, I rush into your hallway
 
 Lean against your velvet door
 
 I watch upon your scorpion
 
 Who crawls across your circus floor
 
 Just what do you think you have to guard?
 
 You know I want your lovin’
 
 Honey, but you’re so hard
 
 
 
 Achilles is in your alleyway
 
 He don’t want me here, he does brag
 
 He’s pointing to the sky
 
 And he’s hungry, like a man in drag
 
 How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
 
 You know I want your lovin’
 
 Honey, but you’re so hard"

1966,Blonde on Blonde,Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again,"Oh, the ragman draws circles
 
 Up and down the block
 
 I’d ask him what the matter was
 
 But I know that he don’t talk
 
 And the ladies treat me kindly
 
 And furnish me with tape
 
 But deep inside my heart
 
 I know I can’t escape
 
 Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
 
 To be stuck inside of Mobile
 
 With the Memphis blues again
 
 
 
 Well, Shakespeare, he’s in the alley
 
 With his pointed shoes and his bells
 
 Speaking to some French girl
 
 Who says she knows me well
 
 And I would send a message
 
 To find out if she’s talked
 
 But the post office has been stolen
 
 And the mailbox is locked
 
 Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
 
 To be stuck inside of Mobile
 
 With the Memphis blues again
 
 
 
 Mona tried to tell me
 
 To stay away from the train line
 
 She said that all the railroad men
 
 Just drink up your blood like wine
 
 An’ I said, “Oh, I didn’t know that
 
 But then again, there’s only one I’ve met
 
 An’ he just smoked my eyelids
 
 An’ punched my cigarette”
 
 Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
 
 To be stuck inside of Mobile

 Grandpa died last week
 
 And now he’s buried in the rocks
 
 But everybody still talks about
 
 How badly they were shocked
 
 But me, I expected it to happen

 When he built a fire on Main Street
 
 And shot it full of holes
 
 Oh, Mama, can this really be the end

 With the Memphis blues again
 
 
 
 Now the senator came down here
 
 Showing ev’ryone his gun
 
 Handing out free tickets
 
 To the wedding of his son
 
 An’ me, I nearly got busted
 
 An’ wouldn’t it be my luck
 
 To get caught without a ticket
 
 And be discovered beneath a truck
 
 Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
 
 To be stuck inside of Mobile
 
 With the Memphis blues again
 
 
 
 Now the preacher looked so baffled
 
 When I asked him why he dressed
 
 With twenty pounds of headlines
 
 Stapled to his chest
 
 But he cursed me when I proved it to him
 
 Then I whispered, “Not even you can hide
 
 You see, you’re just like me
 
 I hope you’re satisfied”
 
 Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
 
 To be stuck inside of Mobile
 
 With the Memphis blues again
 
 
 
 Now the rainman gave me two cures
 
 Then he said, “Jump right in”
 
 The one was Texas medicine
 
 The other was just railroad gin
 
 An’ like a fool I mixed them
 
 An’ it strangled up my mind
 
 An’ now people just get uglier
 
 An’ I have no sense of time
 
 Oh, Mama, can this really be the end

 In her honky-tonk lagoon
 
 Where I can watch her waltz for free
 
 ’Neath her Panamanian moon

 You must know about my debutante”
 
 An’ she says, “Your debutante just knows what you need
 
 But I know what you want”
 
 Oh, Mama, can this really be the end

 Now the bricks lay on Grand Street
 
 Where the neon madmen climb
 
 They all fall there so perfectly
 
 It all seems so well timed
 
 An’ here I sit so patiently
 
 Waiting to find out what price
 
 You have to pay to get out of
 
 Going through all these things twice
 
 Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
 
 To be stuck inside of Mobile

1966,Blonde on Blonde,Visions of Johanna,"Ain’t it just like the night to play tricks when you’re tryin' to be so quiet?
 
 We sit here stranded, though we’re all doin’ our best to deny it
 
 And Louise holds a handful of rain, temptin’ you to defy it
 
 Lights flicker from the opposite loft
 
 In this room the heat pipes just cough
 
 The country music station plays soft
 
 But there’s nothing, really nothing to turn off
 
 Just Louise and her lover so entwined
 
 And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind
 
 
 
 In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman’s bluff with the key chain
 
 And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the “D” train
 
 We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight
 
 Ask himself if it’s him or them that’s really insane
 
 Louise, she’s all right, she’s just near
 
 She’s delicate and seems like the mirror
 
 But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
 
 That Johanna’s not here
 
 The ghost of ’lectricity howls in the bones of her face
 
 Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place
 
 
 
 Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously
 
 He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously
 
 And when bringing her name up
 
 He speaks of a farewell kiss to me
 
 He’s sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all
 
 Muttering small talk at the wall while I’m in the hall
 
 How can I explain?
 
 Oh, it’s so hard to get on
 
 And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn
 
 
 
 Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial
 
 Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while
 
 But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues
 
 You can tell by the way she smiles
 
 See the primitive wallflower freeze
 
 When the jelly-faced women all sneeze
 
 Hear the one with the mustache say, “Jeeze
 
 I can’t find my knees”
 
 Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
 
 But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel
 
 
 
 The peddler now speaks to the countess who’s pretending to care for him
 
 Sayin’, “Name me someone that’s not a parasite and I’ll go out and say a prayer for him”
 
 But like Louise always says
 
 “Ya can’t look at much, can ya man?”
 
 As she, herself, prepares for him
 
 And Madonna, she still has not showed
 
 We see this empty cage now corrode
 
 Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
 
 The fiddler, he now steps to the road
 
 He writes ev’rything’s been returned which was owed
 
 On the back of the fish truck that loads
 
 While my conscience explodes
 
 The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
 
 And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain"

At any cost

But how long, babe

Can you search for what’s not lost?

Everybody will help you

Some people are very kind

But if I can save you any time

Come on, give it to me

I’ll keep it with mine



I can’t help it

If you might think I’m odd

If I say I’m not loving you for what you are

But for what you’re not

Everybody will help you

Discover what you set out to find

But if I can save you any time

Come on, give it to me

At half past ten

But it’ll be back tomorrow

Same time again

He’s still stuck on the line

But if I can save you any time

Come on, give it to me

I’ll keep it with mine"

 Blackmail and deceit
 
 And I’ve served time for ev’rything
 
 ’Cept beggin’ on the street
 
 
 
 Well, once I was rather prosperous
 
 There was nothing I did lack
 
 I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth
 
 And silk upon my back
 
 But I did not trust my brother
 
 I carried him to blame
 
 Which led me to my fatal doom
 
 To wander off in shame
 
 
 
 Kind ladies and kind gentlemen
 
 Soon I will be gone

 Lest you wind up on this road"

 You always act surprised
 
 You say, “How are you?” “Good luck”

 Why don’t you just come out once
 
 And scream it
 
 
 
 No, I do not feel that good

 Perhaps I’d rob them

 I could be you
 
 
 
 Yes, I wish that for just one time

 I heard the drifter say
 
 As they carried him from the courtroom
 
 And were taking him away
 
 “My trip hasn’t been a pleasant one
 
 And my time it isn’t long
 
 And I still do not know
 
 What it was that I’ve done wrong”
 
 
 
 Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside
 
 A tear came to his eye
 
 “You fail to understand,” he said
 
 “Why must you even try?”
 
 Outside, the crowd was stirring
 
 You could hear it from the door
 
 Inside, the judge was stepping down
 
 While the jury cried for more
 
 
 
 “Oh, stop that cursed jury”
 
 Cried the attendant and the nurse
 
 “The trial was bad enough
 
 But this is ten times worse”
 
 Just then a bolt of lightning
 
 Struck the courthouse out of shape
 
 And while ev’rybody knelt to pray
 
 The drifter did escape"

 “There’s too much confusion, I can’t get no relief
 
 Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth
 
 None of them along the line know what any of it is worth”
 
 
 
 “No reason to get excited,” the thief, he kindly spoke
 
 “There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke
 
 But you and I, we’ve been through that, and this is not our fate
 
 So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late”
 
 
 
 All along the watchtower, princes kept the view
 
 While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too
 
 
 
 Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl
 
 Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl"
1967,John Wesley Harding,As I Went Out One Morning,"As I went out one morning
 
 To breathe the air around Tom Paine’s
 
 I spied the fairest damsel
 
 That ever did walk in chains
 
 I offer’d her my hand
 
 She took me by the arm
 
 I knew that very instant
 
 She meant to do me harm
 
 
 
 “Depart from me this moment”
 
 I told her with my voice
 
 Said she, “But I don’t wish to”
 
 Said I, “But you have no choice”
 
 “I beg you, sir,” she pleaded
 
 From the corners of her mouth
 
 “I will secretly accept you
 
 And together we’ll fly south”
 
 
 
 Just then Tom Paine, himself
 
 Came running from across the field
 
 Shouting at this lovely girl
 
 And commanding her to yield
 
 And as she was letting go her grip
 
 Up Tom Paine did run,
 
 “I’m sorry, sir,” he said to me
 
 “I’m sorry for what she’s done”"

 Was a friend to the poor
 
 He trav’led with a gun in ev’ry hand

 But he was never known
 
 To hurt an honest man
 
 
 
 ’Twas down in Chaynee County
 
 A time they talk about
 
 With his lady by his side
 
 He took a stand
 
 And soon the situation there
 
 Was all but straightened out
 
 For he was always known
 
 To lend a helping hand
 
 
 
 All across the telegraph
 
 His name it did resound
 
 But no charge held against him
 
 Could they prove
 
 And there was no man around
 
 Who could track or chain him down
 
 He was never known
 
 To make a foolish move"
1967,John Wesley Harding,The Wicked Messenger,"There was a wicked messenger
 
 From Eli he did come
 
 With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter
 
 When questioned who had sent for him
 
 He answered with his thumb
 
 For his tongue it could not speak, but only flatter
 
 
 
 He stayed behind the assembly hall
 
 It was there he made his bed
 
 Oftentimes he could be seen returning
 
 Until one day he just appeared
 
 With a note in his hand which read
 
 “The soles of my feet, I swear they’re burning”
 
 
 
 Oh, the leaves began to fallin’
 
 And the seas began to part
 
 And the people that confronted him were many
 
 And he was told but these few words
 
 Which opened up his heart
 
 “If ye cannot bring good news, then don’t bring any”"

1967,John Wesley Harding,I'll Be Your Baby Tonight,"Close your eyes, close the door
 
 You don’t have to worry anymore
 
 I’ll be your baby tonight
 
 
 
 Shut the light, shut the shade
 
 You don’t have to be afraid
 
 I’ll be your baby tonight
 
 
 
 Well, that mockingbird’s gonna sail away
 
 We’re gonna forget it
 
 That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon
 
 But we’re gonna let it
 
 You won’t regret it
 
 
 
 Kick your shoes off, do not fear
 
 Bring that bottle over here
 
 I’ll be your baby tonight"
1967,John Wesley Harding,I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine,"I dreamed I saw St. Augustine
 
 Alive as you or me
 
 Tearing through these quarters
 
 In the utmost misery
 
 With a blanket underneath his arm
 
 And a coat of solid gold
 
 Searching for the very souls
 
 Whom already have been sold
 
 
 
 “Arise, arise,” he cried so loud
 
 In a voice without restraint
 
 “Come out, ye gifted kings and queens
 
 And hear my sad complaint
 
 No martyr is among ye now
 
 Whom you can call your own
 
 So go on your way accordingly
 
 But know you’re not alone”
 
 
 
 I dreamed I saw St. Augustine
 
 Alive with fiery breath
 
 And I dreamed I was amongst the ones
 
 That put him out to death
 
 Oh, I awoke in anger
 
 So alone and terrified
 
 I put my fingers against the glass
 
 And bowed my head and cried"
1967,John Wesley Harding,The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest,"Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest
 
 They were the best of friends
 
 So when Frankie Lee needed money one day
 
 Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
 
 And placed them on a footstool
 
 Just above the plotted plain
 
 Sayin’, “Take your pick, Frankie Boy
 
 My loss will be your gain”
 
 
 
 Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down
 
 And put his fingers to his chin
 
 But with the cold eyes of Judas on him
 
 His head began to spin
 
 “Would ya please not stare at me like that,” he said
 
 “It’s just my foolish pride
 
 But sometimes a man must be alone
 
 And this is no place to hide”
 
 
 
 Well, Judas, he just winked and said
 
 “All right, I’ll leave you here
 
 But you’d better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want
 
 Before they all disappear”
 
 “I’m gonna start my pickin’ right now
 
 Just tell me where you’ll be”
 
 Judas pointed down the road
 
 And said, “Eternity!”
 
 
 
 “Eternity?” said Frankie Lee
 
 With a voice as cold as ice
 
 “That’s right,” said Judas Priest, “Eternity
 
 Though you might call it ‘Paradise’”
 
 “I don’t call it anything”
 
 Said Frankie Lee with a smile
 
 “All right,” said Judas Priest
 
 “I’ll see you after a while”
 
 
 
 Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down
 
 Feelin’ low and mean
 
 When just then a passing stranger
 
 Burst upon the scene
 
 Saying, “Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler
 
 Whose father is deceased?
 
 Well, if you are, there’s a fellow callin’ you down the road
 
 And they say his name is Priest”
 
 
 
 “Oh, yes, he is my friend”
 
 Said Frankie Lee in fright
 
 “I do recall him very well
 
 In fact, he just left my sight”
 
 “Yes, that’s the one,” said the stranger
 
 As quiet as a mouse
 
 “Well, my message is, he’s down the road
 
 Stranded in a house”
 
 
 
 Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked
 
 He dropped ev’rything and ran
 
 Until he came up to the spot
 
 Where Judas Priest did stand
 
 “What kind of house is this,” he said
 
 “Where I have come to roam?”
 
 “It’s not a house,” said Judas Priest
 
 “It’s not a house . . . it’s a home”
 
 
 
 Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled
 
 He soon lost all control
 
 Over ev’rything which he had made
 
 While the mission bells did toll
 
 He just stood there staring
 
 At that big house as bright as any sun
 
 With four and twenty windows
 
 And a woman’s face in ev’ry one
 
 
 
 Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee
 
 With a soulful, bounding leap
 
 And, foaming at the mouth
 
 He began to make his midnight creep
 
 For sixteen nights and days he raved
 
 But on the seventeenth he burst
 
 Into the arms of Judas Priest
 
 Which is where he died of thirst
 
 
 
 No one tried to say a thing
 
 When they took him out in jest
 
 Except, of course, the little neighbor boy
 
 Who carried him to rest
 
 And he just walked along, alone
 
 With his guilt so well concealed
 
 And muttered underneath his breath
 
 “Nothing is revealed”
 
 
 
 Well, the moral of the story
 
 The moral of this song
 
 Is simply that one should never be
 
 Where one does not belong
 
 So when you see your neighbor carryin’ somethin’
 
 Help him with his load
 
 And don’t go mistaking Paradise
 
 For that home across the road"
1967,John Wesley Harding,I Pity the Poor Immigrant,"I pity the poor immigrant
 
 Who wishes he would’ve stayed home
 
 Who uses all his power to do evil
 
 But in the end is always left so alone
 
 That man whom with his fingers cheats
 
 And who lies with ev’ry breath
 
 Who passionately hates his life
 
 And likewise, fears his death
 
 
 
 I pity the poor immigrant
 
 Whose strength is spent in vain
 
 Whose heaven is like Ironsides
 
 Whose tears are like rain
 
 Who eats but is not satisfied
 
 Who hears but does not see
 
 Who falls in love with wealth itself
 
 And turns his back on me
 
 
 
 I pity the poor immigrant
 
 Who tramples through the mud
 
 Who fills his mouth with laughing
 
 And who builds his town with blood
 
 Whose visions in the final end
 
 Must shatter like the glass
 
 I pity the poor immigrant
 
 When his gladness comes to pass"

 That’s what they explain to me
 
 Just do your thing, you’ll be king
 
 If dogs run free
 
 
 
 If dogs run free, why not me
 
 Across the swamp of time?
 
 My mind weaves a symphony
 
 And tapestry of rhyme
 
 Oh, winds which rush my tale to thee
 
 So it may flow and be
 
 To each his own, it’s all unknown
 
 If dogs run free
 
 
 
 If dogs run free, then what must be
 
 Must be, and that is all

 Drive you from your fear
 
 Bring you through the mirror

 And he can do it here”

 But the next time I looked there was light in the room
 
 And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill
 
 Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody
 
 Oh, the locusts sang their high whining trill
 
 Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me
 
 
 
 Outside of the gates the trucks were unloadin’
 
 The weather was hot, a-nearly 90 degrees
 
 The man standin’ next to me, his head was exploding
 
 Well, I was prayin’ the pieces wouldn’t fall on me
 
 Yeah, the locusts sang off in the distance
 
 Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody
 
 Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance
 
 And the locusts sang and they were singing for me
 
 
 
 I put down my robe, picked up my diploma
 
 Took hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
 
 Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota
 
 Sure was glad to get out of there alive
 
 And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill
 
 Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody
 
 And the locusts sang with a high whinin’ trill
 
 Yeah, the locusts sang and they was singing for me
 
 Singing for me, well, singing for me"

 I met my little Sadie and I brought her down.
 
 I ran right home and I went to bed
 
 With a forty-four smokeless under my head.

 I grabbed my hat and I began to run.
 
 I made a god run but I ran too slow;
 
 They overtook me down in Jericho
 
 
 
 Standing on a corner ringin' my bell,
 
 Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville.
 
 He said ""Young man is you name Brown?
 
 Remember the night you blowed Little Sadie down.""
 
 
 
 ""Oh, yes sir, my name is Lee.
 
 I murdered little Sadie in the first degree.
 
 First degree and second degree,
 
 If you've got any papers will you serve them to me?""
 
 
 
 Well they took me down town and they dressed me in black.
 
 They put me on a train and they brought me back.
 
 I had no one for to go my bail;
 
 They crammed me back into the county jail.
 
 
 
 The judge and the jury they took their stand.
 
 The judge had the papers in his right hand.
 
 Forty-one days, forty-one nights;
 
 Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes."

1970,New Morning,Time Passes Slowly,"Time passes slowly up here in the mountains
 
 We sit beside bridges and walk beside fountains
 
 Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream
 
 Time passes slowly when you’re lost in a dream
 
 
 
 Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-lookin’
 
 We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cookin’
 
 Stared out the window to the stars high above
 
 Time passes slowly when you’re searchin’ for love
 
 
 
 Ain’t no reason to go in a wagon to town
 
 Ain’t no reason to go to the fair
 
 Ain’t no reason to go up, ain’t no reason to go down
 
 Ain’t no reason to go anywhere

 Time passes slowly and fades away"

 Where I’ve got me a date with Botticelli’s niece
 
 She promised that she’d be right there with me
 
 When I paint my masterpiece
 
 
 
 Oh, the hours I’ve spent inside the Coliseum
 
 Dodging lions and wastin’ time
 
 Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see ’em
 
 Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb
 
 Train wheels runnin’ through the back of my memory
 
 When I ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese
 
 Someday, everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
 
 When I paint my masterpiece
 
 
 
 Sailin’ round the world in a dirty gondola
 
 Oh, to be back in the land of Coca-Cola!
 
 
 
 I left Rome and landed in Brussels
 
 On a plane ride so bumpy that I almost cried
 
 Clergymen in uniform and young girls pullin’ muscles
 
 Everyone was there to greet me when I stepped inside
 
 Newspapermen eating candy
 
 Had to be held down by big police
 
 Someday, everything is gonna be diff’rent
 
 When I paint my masterpiece"

1973,Pat Garrett and Billy The Kid,Billy 4,"There's guns across the river about to pound you

There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you

Bounty hunters are dancing all around you

Billy, they don't like you to be so free.



Camping out all night on the veranda

Walking in the streets down by the hacienda

Up to Boot Hill the like to send you

Billy, don't you turn your back on me.



There's mills inside the minds of crazy faces

Bullet holes and rifles in their cases

There is always one more notch in four more aces

Billy, and you're playing all alone.



Playing around with some sweet signorita

Into her dark chamber she will greet you

In the shadows of the maizes she will lead you

Billy, and you're going all alone.



They say that Pat Garrett's got your number

So sleep with one eye open, when you wander

Every little sound just might be thunder

Thunder from the barrel of his gun.



There's always another stranger sneaking glances

Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances

Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances

Advances on your spirit and your soul.



The businessmen from Taos want you to go down

So they've hired mister Garrett, he'll force you to slow down

Billy, don't let it make you feel so low down

To be hunted by the man who was your friend.



So hang on to your woman, if you got one

Remember in El Paso once you shot one

I'll be in Santa Fe about one

Billy, you've been running for so long.



Gypsy queens will play your grand finale

Way down in some Tularosa alley

Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley

Billy, you're so far away from home

Billy, you're so far away from home"

Nothing ’round here I care to try for

Got nothing left to live or die for

There’s a hymn I used to hear

In the churches all the time

Make me feel so good inside

So peaceful, so sublime

And there’s nothing to remind me of that

Old familiar chime

’Cept you, uh huh you



Used to play in the cemetery

Dance and sing and run when I was a child

Never seemed strange

But now I just pass mournfully by

That place where the bones of life are piled

I know somethin’ has changed

I’m a stranger here and no one sees me

’Cept you, yeah you



Nothing much matters or seems to please me

’Cept you, yeah you

Nothing hypnotizes me

Or holds me in a spell

Everything runs by me

Just like water from a well

Everybody wants my attention

Everybody’s got something to sell

Papa's in the big house, his workin' days are through

Tough Mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?



Dark Lady, Won't you move it on over and make some room?

Rollin’ steady, sweepin’ through the country like a broom

Put your arms around me, like a circle ‘round the sun

You got a pocket full of money but you can’t help me none

Shady Lady, the Dress that you are wearin’ weighs a ton



Angel Baby, born of a blinding light and a changing wind

Drive me crazy, you know who you are and where you’ve been

Starin’ at the ceiling, standin’ on the chair

Big fires blazing, ashes in the air

Angel Baby, I wonder what you done back there



I’m crestfallen—the world of illusion is at my door

I hear you callin’, same old thing like it was before

Crawlin’ through the meadow like a lion in the den

Headin’ for the round-up at the rainbow’s end

Tough Mama, let’s get on the road again"
1974,Planet Waves,Dirge,"I hate myself for lovin’ you and the weakness that it showed

You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road

The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel

I hate myself for lovin’ you and I’m glad the curtain fell



I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed

And the mercy that you showed to me, who ever would have guessed?

I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within

That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin



Heard your songs of freedom and man forever stripped

Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped

Like a slave in orbit, he’s beaten ’til he’s tame

All for a moment’s glory and it’s a dirty, rotten shame



There are those who worship loneliness, I’m not one of them

In this age of fiberglass I’m searching for a gem

The crystal ball up on the wall hasn’t shown me nothing yet

I’ve paid the price of solitude, but at last I’m out of debt



Can’t recall a useful thing you ever did for me

’Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knees

We stared into each other’s eyes ’til one of us would break

No use to apologize, what diff’rence would it make?



So sing your praise of progress and of the Doom Machine

The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen

Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I’m at

I hate myself for lovin’ you, but I should get over that"
1974,Planet Waves,Something There Is About You,"Something there is about you that strikes a match in me

Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?

Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be

Somethin’ that crossed over from another century?



Thought I’d shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth

Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walkin’ the hills of old Duluth

There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black night and then there was Ruth

Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth



Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings

Don’t have to look no further, you’re the soul of many things

I could say that I’d be faithful, I could say it in one sweet, easy breath

But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death



Something there is about you that moves with style and grace

I was in a whirlwind, now I’m in some better place

My hand’s on the sabre and you’ve picked up the baton

Somethin’ there is about you that I can’t quite put my finger on"

I’d give you the sky high above

Ooh, for a little touch of your love



Oh no, I don’t need any reminder

To know how much I really care

But it’s just making me blinder and blinder

Because I’m up on a hill and still you’re not there



Hazel, you called and I came

Now don’t make me play this waiting game

You’ve got something I want plenty of

Ooh, a little touch of your love"

I love you more than money and more than the stars above

Love you more than madness, more than waves upon the sea

Love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me



Ever since you walked right in, the circle’s been complete

I’ve said goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street

To the courtyard of the jester which is hidden from the sun

I love you more than ever and I haven’t yet begun



You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live

When I was deep in poverty you taught me how to give

Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole

Quenched my thirst and satisfied the burning in my soul



You gave me babies one, two, three, what is more, you saved my life

Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife

My thoughts of you don’t ever rest, they’d kill me if I lie

I’d sacrifice the world for you and watch my senses die



The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth

We’ll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth

What’s lost is lost, we can’t regain what went down in the flood

But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood



It’s never been my duty to remake the world at large

Nor is it my intention to sound a battle charge

’Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn’t bend

And if there is eternity I’d love you there again



Oh, can’t you see that you were born to stand by my side

And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride

You’re the other half of what I am, you’re the missing piece

And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn’t cease



You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see

Just bein’ next to you is a natural thing for me

And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on

‘Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone"

I’m just going

I’m gone"
1974,Planet Waves,On a Night Like This,"On a night like this

So glad you came around

Hold on to me so tight

And heat up some coffee grounds

We got much to talk about

And much to reminisce

It sure is right

On a night like this



On a night like this

So glad you’ve come to stay

Hold on to me, pretty miss

Say you’ll never go away to stray

Run your fingers down my spine

Bring me a touch of bliss

It sure feels right

On a night like this



On a night like this

I can’t get any sleep

The air is so cold outside

And the snow’s so deep

Build a fire, throw on logs

And listen to it hiss

And let it burn, burn, burn, burn

On a night like this



Put your body next to mine

And keep me company

There is plenty a-room for all

So please don’t elbow me



Let the four winds blow

Around this old cabin door

If I’m not too far off

I think we did this once before

There’s more frost on the window glass

With each new tender kiss

But it sure feels right

On a night like this"
1974,Planet Waves,Never say goodbye,"Twilight on the frozen lake

North wind about to break

On footprints in the snow

Silence down below



You’re beautiful beyond words

You’re beautiful to me

You can make me cry

Never say goodbye



Time is all I have to give

You can have it if you choose

With me you can live

Never say goodbye



My dreams are made of iron and steel

With a big bouquet

Of roses hanging down

From the heavens to the ground



The crashing waves roll over me

As I stand upon the sand

Wait for you to come

And grab hold of my hand



Oh, baby, baby, baby blue

You’ll change your last name, too

You’ve turned your hair to brown

Love to see it hangin’ down"
1974,Planet Waves,You Angel You,"You angel you

You got me under your wing

The way you walk and the way you talk

I feel I could almost sing



You angel you

You’re as fine as anything’s fine

The way you walk and the way you talk

It sure plays on my mind



You know I can’t sleep at night for trying

Never did feel this way before

I get up at night and walk the floor

If this is love then gimme more

And more and more and more and more



You angel you

You’re as fine as can be

The way you smile like a sweet baby child

It just falls all over me



You know I can’t sleep at night for trying

Never did feel this way before

Never did get up and walk the floor

If this is love then gimme more

And more and more and more



You angel you

You got me under your wing

The way you walk and the way you talk

It says everything"
1975,Blood on the Tracks,Simple Twist of Fate,"They sat together in the park

As the evening sky grew dark

She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones

’Twas then he felt alone and wished that he’d gone straight

And watched out for a simple twist of fate



They walked along by the old canal

A little confused, I remember well

And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burnin’ bright

He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train

Moving with a simple twist of fate



A saxophone someplace far off played

As she was walkin’ by the arcade

As the light bust through a beat-up shade where he was wakin’ up,

She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate

And forgot about a simple twist of fate



He woke up, the room was bare

He didn’t see her anywhere

He told himself he didn’t care, pushed the window open wide

Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate

Brought on by a simple twist of fate



He hears the ticking of the clocks

And walks along with a parrot that talks

Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in

Maybe she’ll pick him out again, how long must he wait

Once more for a simple twist of fate



People tell me it’s a sin

To know and feel too much within

I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring

She was born in spring, but I was born too late

Blame it on a simple twist of fate"
1975,Biograph,Abandoned Love,"I can see the turning of the key
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me
I thought that he was righteous but he's vain
Oh, something's a-telling me I wear the ball and chain
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost
He's always off somewhere when I need him most
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill
But my heart is a-tellin' me I love you still
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
I see you in the streets, I begin to swoon
I love to see you dress before the mirror
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Everybody's wearing a disguise
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes
But me, I can't cover what I am
Wherever the children go I'll follow them
I march in the parade of liberty
But as long as I love you I'm not free
How long must I suffer such abuse?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
I've given up the game, I've got to leave
The pot of gold is only make-believe
The treasure can't be found by men who search
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed
I asked ya please to cross me off your list
My head tells me it's time to make a change
But my heart is telling me I love ya but you're strange
So one more time at midnight, near the wall
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl
Won't you descend from the throne, from where you sit?
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it"
1975,Biograph,Up to Me,"Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing

Death kept followin’, trackin’ us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing

Now somebody’s got to show their hand, time is an enemy

I know you’re long gone, I guess it must be up to me



If I’d thought about it I never would’ve done it, I guess I would’ve let it slide

If I’d lived my life by what others were thinkin’, the heart inside me would’ve died

I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity

Someone had to reach for the risin’ star, I guess it was up to me



Oh, the Union Central is pullin’ out and the orchids are in bloom

I’ve only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume

In fourteen months I’ve only smiled once and I didn’t do it consciously

Somebody’s got to find your trail, I guess it must be up to me



It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch

I’d just about convinced myself that nothin’ had changed that much

The old Rounder in the iron mask slipped me the master key

Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me



Well, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers’ club

I would’ve followed you in the door but I didn’t have a ticket stub

So I waited all night ’til the break of day, hopin’ one of us could get free

When the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me



Oh, the only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk

Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work

Was I a fool or not to try to protect your identity?

You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me



Well, I met somebody face to face and I had to remove my hat

She’s everything I need and love but I can’t be swayed by that

It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be

But she ain’t a-gonna make me move, I guess it must be up to me



We heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex

It didn’t amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects

When you bite off more than you can chew you pay the penalty

Somebody’s got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me



Well, Dupree came in pimpin’ tonight to the Thunderbird Café

Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way

Well, I just can’t rest without you, love, I need your company

But you ain’t a-gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me



There’s a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle

She’s the one you been wond’rin’ about, but there’s really nothin’ much to tell

We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is history

Somebody’s got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me



So go on, boys, and play your hands, life is a pantomime

The ringleaders from the county seat say you don’t have all that much time

And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain’t my property

One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me



And if we never meet again, baby, remember me

How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody

And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you, free

No one else could play that tune, you know it was up to m"
1975,Blood on the Tracks,You're Big Girl Now,"Our conversation was short and sweet

It nearly swept me off-a my feet

And I’m back in the rain, oh, oh

And you are on dry land

You made it there somehow

You’re a big girl now



Bird on the horizon, sittin’ on a fence

He’s singin’ his song for me at his own expense

And I’m just like that bird, oh, oh

Singin’ just for you

I hope that you can hear

Hear me singin’ through these tears



Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast

Oh, but what a shame if all we’ve shared can’t last

I can change, I swear, oh, oh

See what you can do

I can make it through

You can make it too



Love is so simple, to quote a phrase

You’ve known it all the time, I’m learnin’ it these days

Oh, I know where I can find you, oh, oh

In somebody’s room

It’s a price I have to pay

You’re a big girl all the way



A change in the weather is known to be extreme

But what’s the sense of changing horses in midstream?

I’m going out of my mind, oh, oh

With a pain that stops and starts

Like a corkscrew to my heart

Ever since we’ve been apart"

1975,"The Bootleg Series, Vol 1-3: Rare & Unreleased 1961-1991",Golden Loom,"Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky

I see the sailin’ boats across the bay go by

Eucalyptus trees hang above the street

And then I turn my head, for you’re approachin’ me

Moonlight on the water, fisherman’s daughter, floatin’ in to my room

With a golden loom



First we wash our feet near the immortal shrine

And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine

I see the hungry clouds up above your face

And then the tears roll down, what a bitter taste

And then you drift away on a summer’s day where the wildflowers bloom

With your golden loom



I walk across the bridge in the dismal light

Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night

I see the trembling lion with the lotus flower tail

And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil

But you’re gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume

And your golden loom

1975,Blood on the Tracks,Shelter from the Storm,"’Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood

When blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud

I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form

“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”



And if I pass this way again, you can rest assured

I’ll always do my best for her, on that I give my word

In a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm

“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”



Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved

Everything up to that point had been left unresolved

Try imagining a place where it’s always safe and warm

“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”



I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail

Poisoned in the bushes an’ blown out on the trail

Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn

“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”



Suddenly I turned around and she was standin’ there

With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair

She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns

“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”



Now there’s a wall between us, somethin’ there’s been lost

I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed

Just to think that it all began on a long-forgotten morn

“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”



Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount

But nothing really matters much, it’s doom alone that counts

And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn

“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”



I’ve heard newborn babies wailin’ like a mournin’ dove

And old men with broken teeth stranded without love

Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?

“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”



In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes

I bargained for salvation an’ they gave me a lethal dose

I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn

“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”



Well, I’m livin’ in a foreign country but I’m bound to cross the line

Beauty walks a razor’s edge, someday I’ll make it mine

If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born

“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”"
1975,Blood on the Tracks,"Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts","The festival was over, the boys were all plannin’ for a fall

The cabaret was quiet except for the drillin’ in the wall

The curfew had been lifted and the gamblin’ wheel shut down

Anyone with any sense had already left town

He was standin’ in the doorway lookin’ like the Jack of Hearts



He moved across the mirrored room, “Set it up for everyone,” he said

Then everyone commenced to do what they were doin’ before he turned their heads

Then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin

“Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?”

Then he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts



Backstage the girls were playin’ five-card stud by the stairs

Lily had two queens, she was hopin’ for a third to match her pair

Outside the streets were fillin’ up, the window was open wide

A gentle breeze was blowin’, you could feel it from inside

Lily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts



Big Jim was no one’s fool, he owned the town’s only diamond mine

He made his usual entrance lookin’ so dandy and so fine

With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place

He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste

But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts



Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town

She slipped in through the side door lookin’ like a queen without a crown

She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear

“Sorry, darlin’, that I’m late,” but he didn’t seem to hear

He was starin’ into space over at the Jack of Hearts



“I know I’ve seen that face before,” Big Jim was thinkin’ to himself

“Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody’s shelf”

But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the houselights did dim

And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him

Starin’ at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts



Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child

She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled

She’d come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs

With men in every walk of life which took her everywhere

But she’d never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts



The hangin’ judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined

The drillin’ in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind

It was known all around that Lily had Jim’s ring

And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king

No, nothin’ ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts



Rosemary started drinkin’ hard and seein’ her reflection in the knife

She was tired of the attention, tired of playin’ the role of Big Jim’s wife

She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide

Was lookin’ to do just one good deed before she died

She was gazin’ to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts



Lily washed her face, took her dress off and buried it away

“Has your luck run out?” she laughed at him, “Well, I guess you must

    have known it would someday

Be careful not to touch the wall, there’s a brand-new coat of paint

I’m glad to see you’re still alive, you’re lookin’ like a saint”

Down the hallway footsteps were comin’ for the Jack of Hearts



The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair

“There’s something funny going on,” he said, “I can just feel it in the air”

He went to get the hangin’ judge, but the hangin’ judge was drunk

As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk

There was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts



Lily’s arms were locked around the man that she dearly loved to touch

She forgot all about the man she couldn’t stand who hounded her so much

“I’ve missed you so,” she said to him, and he felt she was sincere

But just beyond the door he felt jealousy and fear

Just another night in the life of the Jack of Hearts



No one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick

The door to the dressing room burst open and a cold revolver clicked

And Big Jim was standin’ there, ya couldn’t say surprised

Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes

She was with Big Jim but she was leanin’ to the Jack of Hearts



Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall

And cleaned out the bank safe, it’s said that they got off with quite a haul

In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground

For one more member who had business back in town

But they couldn’t go no further without the Jack of Hearts



The next day was hangin’ day, the sky was overcast and black

Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back

And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn’t even blink

The hangin’ judge was sober, he hadn’t had a drink

The only person on the scene missin’ was the Jack of Hearts



The cabaret was empty now, a sign said, “Closed for repair”

Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair

She was thinkin’ ’bout her father, who she very rarely saw

Thinkin’ ’bout Rosemary and thinkin’ about the law

But most of all she was thinkin’ ’bout the Jack of Hearts"
1975,Blood on the Tracks,Buckets of Rain,"Buckets of rain

Buckets of tears

Got all them buckets comin’ out of my ears

Buckets of moonbeams in my hand

I got all the love, honey baby

You can stand



I been meek

And hard like an oak

I seen pretty people disappear like smoke

Friends will arrive, friends will disappear

If you want me, honey baby

I’ll be here



Like your smile

And your fingertips

Like the way that you move your lips

I like the cool way you look at me

Everything about you is bringing me

Misery



Little red wagon

Little red bike

I ain’t no monkey but I know what I like

I like the way you love me strong and slow

I’m takin’ you with me, honey baby

When I go



Life is sad

Life is a bust

All ya can do is do what you must

You do what you must do and ya do it well

I’ll do it for you, honey baby

Can’t you tell?"
1975,The Basement Tapes,Odds and Ends,"I plan it all and I take my place

You break your promise all over the place

You promised to love me, but what do I see

Just you comin’ and spillin’ juice over me

Odds and ends, odds and ends

Lost time is not found again



Now, you take your file and you bend my head

I never can remember anything that you said

You promised to love me, but what do I know

You’re always spillin’ juice on me like you got someplace to go

Odds and ends, odds and ends

Lost time is not found again



Now, I’ve had enough, my box is clean

You know what I’m sayin’ and you know what I mean

From now on you’d best get on someone else

While you’re doin’ it, keep that juice to yourself

1975,The Basement Tapes,Goin' to Acapulco,"I’m going down to Rose Marie’s

She never does me wrong

She puts it to me plain as day

And gives it to me for a song



It’s a wicked life but what the hell

The stars ain’t falling down

I’m standing outside the Taj Mahal

I don’t see no one around



Goin’ to Acapulco–goin’ on the run

Goin’ down to see fat gut–goin’ to have some fun

Yeah–goin’ to have some fun



Now, whenever I get up

And I ain’t got what I see

I just make it down to Rose Marie’s

’Bout a quarter after three



There are worse ways of getting there

And I ain’t complainin’ none

If the clouds don’t drop and the train don’t stop

I’m bound to meet the sun



Goin’ to Acapulco–goin’ on the run

Goin’ down to see fat gut–goin’ to have some fun

Yeah–goin’ to have some fun



Now, if someone offers me a joke

I just say no thanks

I try to tell it like it is

And keep away from pranks



Well, sometime you know when the well breaks down

I just go pump on it some

Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places

And just set there waitin’ for me to come

1975,Blood on the Tracks,Tangled up in blue,"Early one mornin’ the sun was shinin’

I was layin’ in bed

Wond’rin’ if she’d changed at all

If her hair was still red

Her folks they said our lives together

Sure was gonna be rough

They never did like Mama’s homemade dress

Papa’s bankbook wasn’t big enough

And I was standin’ on the side of the road

Rain fallin’ on my shoes

Heading out for the East Coast

Lord knows I’ve paid some dues gettin’ through

Tangled up in blue



She was married when we first met

Soon to be divorced

I helped her out of a jam, I guess

But I used a little too much force

We drove that car as far as we could

Abandoned it out West

Split up on a dark sad night

Both agreeing it was best

She turned around to look at me

As I was walkin’ away

I heard her say over my shoulder

“We’ll meet again someday on the avenue”

Tangled up in blue



I had a job in the great north woods

Working as a cook for a spell

But I never did like it all that much

And one day the ax just fell

So I drifted down to New Orleans

Where I happened to be employed

Workin’ for a while on a fishin’ boat

Right outside of Delacroix

But all the while I was alone

The past was close behind

I seen a lot of women

But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew

Tangled up in blue



She was workin’ in a topless place

And I stopped in for a beer

I just kept lookin’ at the side of her face

In the spotlight so clear

And later on as the crowd thinned out

I’s just about to do the same

She was standing there in back of my chair

Said to me, “Don’t I know your name?”

I muttered somethin’ underneath my breath

She studied the lines on my face

I must admit I felt a little uneasy

When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe

Tangled up in blue



She lit a burner on the stove

And offered me a pipe

“I thought you’d never say hello,” she said

“You look like the silent type”

Then she opened up a book of poems

And handed it to me

Written by an Italian poet

From the thirteenth century

And every one of them words rang true

And glowed like burnin’ coal

Pourin’ off of every page

Like it was written in my soul from me to you

Tangled up in blue



I lived with them on Montague Street

In a basement down the stairs

There was music in the cafés at night

And revolution in the air

Then he started into dealing with slaves

And something inside of him died

She had to sell everything she owned

And froze up inside

And when finally the bottom fell out

I became withdrawn

The only thing I knew how to do

Was to keep on keepin’ on like a bird that flew

Tangled up in blue



So now I’m goin’ back again

I got to get to her somehow

All the people we used to know

They’re an illusion to me now

Some are mathematicians

Some are carpenters’ wives

Don’t know how it all got started

I don’t know what they’re doin’ with their lives

But me, I’m still on the road

Headin’ for another joint

We always did feel the same

We just saw it from a different point of view

1975,Blood on the Tracks,"If You See Her, Say Hello","If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier

It’s the city ’cross the water, not too far from here

Say for me that I’m all right though things are kind of slow

She might think that I’ve forgotten her. Don’t tell her it isn’t so



We had a falling-out, like lovers sometimes do

But to think of how she left that night, it hurts me through and through

And though our situation pierced me to the bone

I got to find someone to take her place. I don’t like to be alone



I see a lot of people as I make the rounds

And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town

And I’ve never gotten used to it, I’ve just learned to turn it off

Her eyes were blue, her hair was too, her skin so sweet and soft



Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past

I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast

If she’s passin’ back this way, and I sure hope she don’t

Tell her she can look me up. I’ll either be here or I won’t"

I looked at my wrist

Punched myself in the face

1975,Blood on the Tracks,Idiot Wind,"Someone’s got it in for me, they’re planting stories in the press

Whoever it is I wish they’d cut it out but when they will I can only guess

They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy

She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me

I can’t help it if I’m lucky



People see me all the time and they just can’t remember how to act

Their minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts

Even you, yesterday you had to ask me where it was at

I couldn’t believe after all these years, you didn’t know me better than that

Sweet lady



Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your mouth

Blowing down the backroads headin’ south

Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth

You’re an idiot, babe

It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe



I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike

I haven’t known peace and quiet for so long I can’t remember what it’s like

There’s a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pourin’ out of a boxcar door

You didn’t know it, you didn’t think it could be done, in the final end he won the wars

After losin’ every battle



I woke up on the roadside, daydreamin’ ’bout the way things sometimes are

Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are makin’ me see stars

You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies

One day you’ll be in the ditch, flies buzzin’ around your eyes

Blood on your saddle



Idiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb

Blowing through the curtains in your room

Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth

You’re an idiot, babe

It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe



It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart

You tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn’t enough to change my heart

Now everything’s a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped

What’s good is bad, what’s bad is good, you’ll find out when you reach the top

You’re on the bottom



I noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blind

I can’t remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes

    don’t look into mine

The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the

    building burned

I waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees, while the

    springtime turned

Slowly into Autumn



Idiot wind, blowing like a circle around my skull

From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol

Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth

You’re an idiot, babe

It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe



I can’t feel you anymore, I can’t even touch the books you’ve read

Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishin’ I was somebody else instead

Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy

I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory

And all your ragin’ glory



I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I’m finally free

I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me

You’ll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above

And I’ll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love

And it makes me feel so sorry



Idiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats

Blowing through the letters that we wrote

Idiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves

We’re idiots, babe

It’s a wonder we can even feed ourselves"

“It’s just somethin’ we’re gonna have to forget”

I said, “Some of ’em, not all of ’em”

He said, “Ya always help out around here with the chores?”

1976,Desire,Hurricane,"Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night

Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall

She sees the bartender in a pool of blood

Cries out, “My God, they killed them all!”

Here comes the story of the Hurricane

The man the authorities came to blame

For somethin’ that he never done

Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been

The champion of the world



Three bodies lyin’ there does Patty see

And another man named Bello, movin’ around mysteriously

“I didn’t do it,” he says, and he throws up his hands

“I was only robbin’ the register, I hope you understand

I saw them leavin’,” he says, and he stops

“One of us had better call up the cops”

And so Patty calls the cops

And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin’

In the hot New Jersey night



Meanwhile, far away in another part of town

Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin’ around

Number one contender for the middleweight crown

Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down

When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road

Just like the time before and the time before that

In Paterson that’s just the way things go

If you’re black you might as well not show up on the street

’Less you wanna draw the heat



Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops

Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin’ around

He said, “I saw two men runnin’ out, they looked like middleweights

They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates”

And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head

Cop said, “Wait a minute, boys, this one’s not dead”

So they took him to the infirmary

And though this man could hardly see

They told him that he could identify the guilty men



Four in the mornin’ and they haul Rubin in

Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs

The wounded man looks up through his one dyin’ eye

Says, “Wha’d you bring him in here for? He ain’t the guy!”

Yes, here’s the story of the Hurricane

The man the authorities came to blame

For somethin’ that he never done

Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been

The champion of the world



Four months later, the ghettos are in flame

Rubin’s in South America, fightin’ for his name

While Arthur Dexter Bradley’s still in the robbery game

And the cops are puttin’ the screws to him, lookin’ for somebody to blame

“Remember that murder that happened in a bar?”

“Remember you said you saw the getaway car?”

“You think you’d like to play ball with the law?”

“Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin’ that night?”

“Don’t forget that you are white”



Arthur Dexter Bradley said, “I’m really not sure”

Cops said, “A poor boy like you could use a break

We got you for the motel job and we’re talkin’ to your friend Bello

Now you don’t wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow

You’ll be doin’ society a favor

That sonofabitch is brave and gettin’ braver

We want to put his ass in stir

We want to pin this triple murder on him

He ain’t no Gentleman Jim”



Rubin could take a man out with just one punch

But he never did like to talk about it all that much

It’s my work, he’d say, and I do it for pay

And when it’s over I’d just as soon go on my way

Up to some paradise

Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice

And ride a horse along a trail

But then they took him to the jailhouse

Where they try to turn a man into a mouse



All of Rubin’s cards were marked in advance

The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance

The judge made Rubin’s witnesses drunkards from the slums

To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum

And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger

No one doubted that he pulled the trigger

And though they could not produce the gun

The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed

And the all-white jury agreed



Rubin Carter was falsely tried

The crime was murder “one,” guess who testified?

Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied

And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride

How can the life of such a man

Be in the palm of some fool’s hand?

To see him obviously framed

Couldn’t help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land

Where justice is a game



Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties

Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise

While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell

An innocent man in a living hell

That’s the story of the Hurricane

But it won’t be over till they clear his name

And give him back the time he’s done

Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been

The champion of the world

1976,Desire,Mozambique,"I like to spend some time in Mozambique

The sunny sky is aqua blue

And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek

It’s very nice to stay a week or two



There’s lot of pretty girls in Mozambique

And plenty time for good romance

And everybody likes to stop and speak

To give the special one you seek a chance

Or maybe say hello with just a glance



Lying next to her by the ocean

Reaching out and touching her hand

Whispering your secret emotion

Magic in a magical land



And when it’s time for leaving Mozambique

To say goodbye to sand and sea

You turn around to take a final peek

And you see why it’s so unique to be

Among the lovely people living free

Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique

On the pillow where you lie

No gratitude or love

Your loyalty is not to me

But to the stars above



One more cup of coffee for the road

One more cup of coffee ’fore I go

To the valley below



Your daddy he’s an outlaw

And a wanderer by trade

He’ll teach you how to pick and choose

And how to throw the blade

He oversees his kingdom

So no stranger does intrude

His voice it trembles as he calls out

For another plate of food



One more cup of coffee for the road

One more cup of coffee ’fore I go

To the valley below



Your sister sees the future

Like your mama and yourself

You’ve never learned to read or write

There’s no books upon your shelf

And your pleasure knows no limits

Your voice is like a meadowlark

But your heart is like an ocean

Mysterious and dark

One more cup of coffee ’fore I go

I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells

I’d taken the cure and had just gotten through

Stayin’ up for days in the Chelsea Hotel

Writin’ “Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands” for you



Sara, Sara

Wherever we travel we’re never apart

Sara, oh Sara

Beautiful lady, so dear to my heart



How did I meet you? I don’t know

A messenger sent me in a tropical storm

You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow

And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm



Sara, oh Sara

Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress

Sara, Sara

You must forgive me my unworthiness



Now the beach is deserted except for some kelp

And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore

You always responded when I needed your help

You gimme a map and a key to your door



Sara, oh Sara

Glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow

Sara, oh Sara

Don’t ever leave me, don’t ever go
"
1976,Desire,Isis,"I married Isis on the fifth day of May

But I could not hold on to her very long

So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away

For the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong



I came to a high place of darkness and light

The dividing line ran through the center of town

I hitched up my pony to a post on the right

Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down



A man in the corner approached me for a match

I knew right away he was not ordinary

He said, “Are you lookin’ for somethin’ easy to catch?”

I said, “I got no money.” He said, “That ain’t necessary”



We set out that night for the cold in the North

I gave him my blanket, he gave me his word

I said, “Where are we goin’?” He said we’d be back by the fourth

I said, “That’s the best news that I’ve ever heard”



I was thinkin’ about turquoise, I was thinkin’ about gold

I was thinkin’ about diamonds and the world’s biggest necklace

As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold

I was thinkin’ about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless



How she told me that one day we would meet up again

And things would be different the next time we wed

If I only could hang on and just be her friend

I still can’t remember all the best things she said



We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice

He said, “There’s a body I’m tryin’ to find

If I carry it out it’ll bring a good price”

’Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind



The wind it was howlin’ and the snow was outrageous

We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn

When he died I was hopin’ that it wasn’t contagious

But I made up my mind that I had to go on



I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty

There was no jewels, no nothin’, I felt I’d been had

When I saw that my partner was just bein’ friendly

When I took up his offer I must-a been mad



I picked up his body and I dragged him inside

Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover

I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied

Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her



She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise

Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed

I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes

I cursed her one time then I rode on ahead



She said, “Where ya been?” I said, “No place special”

She said, “You look different.” I said, “Well, not quite”

She said, “You been gone.” I said, “That’s only natural”

She said, “You gonna stay?” I said, “Yeah, I jes might”



Isis, oh, Isis, you mystical child

What drives me to you is what drives me insane

I still can remember the way that you smiled

On the fifth day of May in the drizzlin’ rain"
1976,Desire,Romance in Durango,"Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun

Dust on my face and my cape

Me and Magdalena on the run

I think this time we shall escape



Sold my guitar to the baker’s son

For a few crumbs and a place to hide

But I can get another one

And I’ll play for Magdalena as we ride



No llores, mi querida

Dios nos vigila

Soon the horse will take us to Durango

Agarrame, mi vida

Soon the desert will be gone

Soon you will be dancing the fandango



Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people

Hoofbeats like castanets on stone

At night I dream of bells in the village steeple

Then I see the bloody face of Ramon



Was it me that shot him down in the cantina

Was it my hand that held the gun?

Come, let us fly, my Magdalena

The dogs are barking and what’s done is done



No Ilores, mi querida

Dios nos vigila

Soon the horse will take us to Durango

Agarrame, mi vida

Soon the desert will be gone

Soon you will be dancing the fandango



At the corrida we’ll sit in the shade

And watch the young torero stand alone

We’ll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed

When they rode with Villa into Torreón



Then the padre will recite the prayers of old

In the little church this side of town

I will wear new boots and an earring of gold

You’ll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown



The way is long but the end is near

Already the fiesta has begun

The face of God will appear

With His serpent eyes of obsidian



No Ilores, mi querida

Dio nos vigila

Soon the horse will take us to Durango

Agarrame, mi vida

Soon the desert will be gone

Soon you will be dancing the fandango



Was that the thunder that I heard?

My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain

Come sit by me, don’t say a word

Oh, can it be that I am slain?



Quick, Magdalena, take my gun

Look up in the hills, that flash of light

Aim well my little one

We may not make it through the night



No Ilores, mi querida

Dios nos vigila

Soon the horse will take us to Durango

Agarrame, mi vida

Soon the desert will be gone

Soon you will be dancing the fandango"
1976,Desire,Black Diamond Bay,"Up on the white veranda

She wears a necktie and a Panama hat

Her passport shows a face

From another time and place

She looks nothin’ like that

And all the remnants of her recent past

Are scattered in the wild wind

She walks across the marble floor

Where a voice from the gambling room is callin’ her to come on in

She smiles, walks the other way

As the last ship sails and the moon fades away

From Black Diamond Bay



As the mornin’ light breaks open, the Greek comes down

And he asks for a rope and a pen that will write

“Pardon, monsieur,” the desk clerk says

Carefully removes his fez

“Am I hearin’ you right?”

And as the yellow fog is liftin’

The Greek is quickly headin’ for the second floor

She passes him on the spiral staircase

Thinkin’ he’s the Soviet Ambassador

She starts to speak, but he walks away

As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway

On Black Diamond Bay



A soldier sits beneath the fan

Doin’ business with a tiny man who sells him a ring

Lightning strikes, the lights blow out

The desk clerk wakes and begins to shout

“Can you see anything?”

Then the Greek appears on the second floor

In his bare feet with a rope around his neck

While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle

Says, “Open up another deck”

But the dealer says, “Attendez-vous, s’il vous plait”

As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away

From Black Diamond Bay



The desk clerk heard the woman laugh

As he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough

He tried to grab the woman’s hand

Said, “Here’s a ring, it cost a grand”

She said, “That ain’t enough”

Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags

While a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb

She passed the door that the Greek had locked

Where a handwritten sign read, “Do Not Disturb”

She knocked upon it anyway

As the sun went down and the music did play

On Black Diamond Bay



“I’ve got to talk to someone quick!”

But the Greek said, “Go away,” and he kicked the chair to the floor

He hung there from the chandelier

She cried, “Help, there’s danger near

Please open up the door!”

Then the volcano erupted

And the lava flowed down from the mountain high above

The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner

Thinking of forbidden love

But the desk clerk said, “It happens every day”

As the stars fell down and the fields burned away

On Black Diamond Bay



As the island slowly sank

The loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room

The dealer said, “It’s too late now

You can take your money, but I don’t know how

You’ll spend it in the tomb”

The tiny man bit the soldier’s ear

As the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew

While she’s out on the balcony, where a stranger tells her

“My darling, je vous aime beaucoup”

She sheds a tear and then begins to pray

As the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away

From Black Diamond Bay



I was sittin’ home alone one night in L.A.

Watchin’ old Cronkite on the seven o’clock news

It seems there was an earthquake that

Left nothin’ but a Panama hat

And a pair of old Greek shoes

Didn’t seem like much was happenin’,

So I turned it off and went to grab another beer

Seems like every time you turn around

There’s another hard-luck story that you’re gonna hear

And there’s really nothin’ anyone can say

And I never did plan to go anyway

To Black Diamond Bay"
1976,"The Bootleg Series, Vol 1-3: Rare & Unreleased 1961-1991",Seven Days,"Seven days, seven more days she’ll be comin’

I’ll be waiting at the station for her to arrive

Seven more days, all I gotta do is survive



She been gone ever since I been a child

Ever since I seen her smile, I ain’t forgotten her eyes

She had a face that could outshine the sun in the skies



I been good, I been good while I been waitin’

Maybe guilty of hesitatin’, I just been holdin’ on

Seven more days, all that’ll be gone



There’s kissing in the valley

Thieving in the alley

Fighting every inch of the way

Trying to be tender

With somebody I remember

In a night that’s always brighter’n the day



Seven days, seven more days that are connected

Just like I expected, she’ll be comin’ on forth

My beautiful comrade from the north



There’s kissing in the valley

Thieving in the alley

Fighting every inch of the way

Trying to be tender

With somebody I remember

In a night that’s always brighter’n the day"
1976,Desire,Joey,"Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when

Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion

Always on the outside of whatever side there was

When they asked him why it had to be that way, “Well,” he answered,

    “just because”



Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last

They called Joe “Crazy,” the baby they called “Kid Blast”

Some say they lived off gambling and runnin’ numbers too

It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue



Joey, Joey

King of the streets, child of clay

Joey, Joey

What made them want to come and blow you away?



There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that

No one ever knew for sure where they were really at

When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost hit the roof

He went out that night to seek revenge, thinkin’ he was bulletproof



The war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets

Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats

Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners

They stashed them away in a basement, called them amateurs



The hostages were tremblin’ when they heard a man exclaim

“Let’s blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame”

But Joey stepped up, he raised his hand, said, “We’re not those kind of men

It’s peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again”



Joey, Joey

King of the streets, child of clay

Joey, Joey

What made them want to come and blow you away?



The police department hounded him, they called him Mr. Smith

They got him on conspiracy, they were never sure who with

“What time is it?” said the judge to Joey when they met

“Five to ten,” said Joey. The judge says, “That’s exactly what you get”



He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich

They threw him in the hole one time for tryin’ to stop a strike

His closest friends were black men ’cause they seemed to understand

What it’s like to be in society with a shackle on your hand



When they let him out in ’71 he’d lost a little weight

But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great

He tried to find the way back into the life he left behind

To the boss he said, “I have returned and now I want what’s mine”



Joey, Joey

King of the streets, child of clay

Joey, Joey

Why did they have to come and blow you away?



It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun

“I’m around too many children,” he’d say, “they should never know of one”

Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe

Emptied out the register, said, “Tell ’em it was Crazy Joe”



One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York

He could see it comin’ through the door as he lifted up his fork

He pushed the table over to protect his family

Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy



Joey, Joey

King of the streets, child of clay

Joey, Joey

What made them want to come and blow you away?



Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep

I heard his best friend Frankie say, “He ain’t dead, he’s just asleep”

Then I saw the old man’s limousine head back towards the grave

I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save



The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned

They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born

And someday if God’s in heaven overlookin’ His preserve

I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve



Joey, Joey

King of the streets, child of clay

Joey, Joey

What made them want to come and blow you away?"
1976,Desire,"Oh, Sister","Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms

You should not treat me like a stranger

Our Father would not like the way that you act

And you must realize the danger



Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you

And one deserving of affection?

And is our purpose not the same on this earth

To love and follow His direction?



We grew up together

From the cradle to the grave

We died and were reborn

And then mysteriously saved



Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door

Don’t turn away, you’ll create sorrow

Time is an ocean but it ends at the shore

You may not see me tomorrow

1978,Street-legal,Is Your Love in Vain?,"Do you love me, or are you just extending goodwill?

Do you need me half as bad as you say, or are you just feeling guilt?

I’ve been burned before and I know the score

So you won’t hear me complain

Will I be able to count on you

Or is your love in vain?



Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?

When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?

Do you know my world, do you know my kind

Or must I explain?

Will you let me be myself

Or is your love in vain?



Well I’ve been to the mountain and I’ve been in the wind

I’ve been in and out of happiness

I have dined with kings, I’ve been offered wings

And I’ve never been too impressed



All right, I’ll take a chance, I will fall in love with you

If I’m a fool you can have the night, you can have the morning too

Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow

Do you understand my pain?

Are you willing to risk it all

Or is your love in vain?"

How long are we gonna be ridin’?

How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?

Will there be any comfort there, señor?



There’s a wicked wind still blowin’ on that upper deck

There’s an iron cross still hangin' down from around her neck

There’s a marchin’ band still playin’ in that vacant lot

Where she held me in her arms one time and said, “Forget me not”



Señor, señor, I can see that painted wagon

I can smell the tail of the dragon

Can’t stand the suspense anymore

Can you tell me who to contact here, señor?



Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled

Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field

A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring

Said, “Son, this ain’t a dream no more, it’s the real thing”



Señor, señor, you know their hearts is as hard as leather

Well, give me a minute, let me get it together

I just gotta pick myself up off the floor

I’m ready when you are, señor

Overturn these tables

This place don’t make sense to me no more

1978,Street-legal,No Time to Think,"In death, you face life with a child and a wife

Who sleep-walks through your dreams into walls

You’re a soldier of mercy, you’re cold and you curse

“He who cannot be trusted must fall”



Loneliness, tenderness, high society, notoriety

You fight for the throne and you travel alone

Unknown as you slowly sink

And there’s no time to think



In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity

In secret, for pieces of change

The empress attracts you but oppression distracts you

And it makes you feel violent and strange



Memory, ecstasy, tyranny, hypocrisy

Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss

In the valley of the missing link

And you have no time to think



Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you

Her worst is better than best

I’ve seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes

And I feel so depressed



China doll, alcohol, duality, mortality

Mercury rules you and destiny fools you

Like the plague, with a dangerous wink

And there’s no time to think



Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you

Where the lion lies down with the lamb

I’d have paid off the traitor and killed him much later

But that’s just the way that I am



Paradise, sacrifice, mortality, reality

But the magician is quicker and his game

Is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink

And there’s no time to think



Anger and jealousy’s all that he sells us

He’s content when you’re under his thumb

Madmen oppose him, but your kindness throws him

To survive it you play deaf and dumb



Equality, liberty, humility, simplicity

You glance through the mirror and there’s eyes staring clear

At the back of your head as you drink

And there’s no time to think



Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow

Will offer their heads for a prayer

You can’t find no salvation, you have no expectations

Anytime, anyplace, anywhere



Mercury, gravity, nobility, humility

You know you can’t keep her and the water gets deeper

That is leading you onto the brink

But there’s no time to think



You’ve murdered your vanity, buried your sanity

For pleasure you must now resist

Lovers obey you but they cannot sway you

They’re not even sure you exist



Socialism, hypnotism, patriotism, materialism

Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws

And the sound of the keys as they clink

But there’s no time to think



The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl

With the rose in her hair

Starlight in the East and you’re finally released

You’re stranded but with nothing to share



Loyalty, unity, epitome, rigidity

You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille

’Neath the moon shinin’ bloody and pink

And there’s no time to think



Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you

But no, you will not be deceived

Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt

You can give but you cannot receive



No time to choose when the truth must die

No time to lose or say goodbye

No time to prepare for the victim that’s there

No time to suffer or blink

And no time to think"
1978,Street-legal,True Love Tends to Forget,"I’m getting weary looking in my baby’s eyes

When she’s near me she’s so hard to recognize

I finally realize there’s no room for regret

True love, true love, true love tends to forget



Hold me, baby be near

You told me that you’d be sincere

Every day of the year’s like playin’ Russian roulette

True love, true love, true love tends to forget



I was lyin’ down in the reeds without any oxygen

I saw you in the wilderness among the men

Saw you drift into infinity and come back again

All you got to do is wait and I’ll tell you when



You’re a tearjerker, baby, but I’m under your spell

You’re a hard worker, baby, and I know you well

But this weekend in hell is making me sweat

True love, true love, true love tends to forget



I was lyin’ down in the reeds without any oxygen

I saw you in the wilderness among the men

Saw you drift into infinity and come back again

All you got to do is wait and I’ll tell you when



You belong to me, baby, without any doubt

Don’t forsake me, baby, don’t sell me out

Don’t keep me knockin’ about from Mexico to Tibet

True love, true love, true love tends to forget"
1978,Street-legal,We Better Talk This Over,"I think we better talk this over

Maybe when we both get sober

You’ll understand I’m only a man

Doin’ the best that I can



This situation can only get rougher

Why should we needlessly suffer?

Let’s call it a day, go our own different ways

Before we decay



You don’t have to be afraid of looking into my face

We’ve done nothing to each other time will not erase



I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling

You been two-faced, you been double-dealing

I took a chance, got caught in the trance

Of a downhill dance



Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?

I’m exiled, you can’t convert me

I’m lost in the haze of your delicate ways

With both eyes glazed



You don’t have to yearn for love, you don’t have to be alone

Somewheres in this universe there’s a place that you can call home



I guess I’ll be leaving tomorrow

If I have to beg, steal or borrow

It’d be great to cross paths in a day and a half

Look at each other and laugh



But I don’t think it’s liable to happen

Like the sound of one hand clappin’

The vows that we kept are now broken and swept

’Neath the bed where we slept



Don’t think of me and fantasize on what we never had

Be grateful for what we’ve shared together and be glad

Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?

Eventually we’ll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope



Oh, babe, time for a new transition

I wish I was a magician

I would wave a wand and tie back the bond

That we’ve both gone beyond"
1978,Street-legal,Where Are You Tonight? (Journey Through Dark Heat),"There’s a long-distance train rolling through the rain

Tears on the letter I write

There’s a woman I long to touch and I miss her so much

But she’s drifting like a satellite



There’s a neon light ablaze in this green smoky haze

Laughter down on Elizabeth Street

And a lonesome bell tone in that valley of stone

Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat



Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise

But he practiced what he preached from the heart

A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted to me

The time and the place that the trouble would start



There’s a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage

And a longtime golden-haired stripper onstage

And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page

Of a book that no one can write

Oh, where are you tonight?



The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure

To live it you have to explode

In that last hour of need, we entirely agreed

Sacrifice was the code of the road



I left town at dawn, with Marcel and St. John

Strong men belittled by doubt

I couldn’t tell her what my private thoughts were

But she had some way of finding them out



He took dead-center aim but he missed just the same

She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf

She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair

And discovered her invisible self



There’s a lion in the road, there’s a demon escaped

There’s a million dreams gone, there’s a landscape being raped

As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape

I won’t but then again, maybe I might

Oh, if I could just find you tonight



I fought with my twin, that enemy within

’Til both of us fell by the way

Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees

While the law looks the other way



Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes

The guy you were lovin’ couldn’t stay clean

It felt outa place, my foot in his face

But he should-a stayed where his money was green



I bit into the root of forbidden fruit

With the juice running down my leg

Then I dealt with your boss, who’d never known about loss

And who always was too proud to beg



There’s a white diamond gloom on the dark side of this room

And a pathway that leads up to the stars

If you don’t believe there’s a price for this sweet paradise

Remind me to show you the scars



There’s a new day at dawn and I’ve finally arrived

If I’m there in the morning, baby, you’ll know I’ve survived

I can’t believe it, I can’t believe I’m alive

But without you it just doesn’t seem right

Oh, where are you tonight?

1978,Street-legal,Changing of the Guards,"Sixteen years

Sixteen banners united over the field

Where the good shepherd grieves

Desperate men, desperate women divided

Spreading their wings ’neath the falling leaves



Fortune calls

I stepped forth from the shadows, to the marketplace

Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down

She’s smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born

On midsummer’s eve, near the tower



The cold-blooded moon

The captain waits above the celebration

Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid

Whose ebony face is beyond communication

The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid



They shaved her head

She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo

A messenger arrived with a black nightingale

I seen her on the stairs and I couldn’t help but follow

Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil



I stumbled to my feet

I rode past destruction in the ditches

With the stitches still mending ’neath a heart-shaped tattoo

Renegade priests and treacherous young witches

Were handing out the flowers that I’d given to you



The palace of mirrors

Where dog soldiers are reflected

The endless road and the wailing of chimes

The empty rooms where her memory is protected

Where the angels’ voices whisper to the souls of previous times



She wakes him up

Forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking

Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks

She’s begging to know what measures he now will be taking

He’s pulling her down and she’s clutching on to his long golden locks



Gentlemen, he said

I don’t need your organization, I’ve shined your shoes

I’ve moved your mountains and marked your cards

But Eden is burning, either brace yourself for elimination

Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards



Peace will come

In a twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet blows

The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes

And ye shall be changed



Everything you’ve gotten

You’ve gotten by sweat, blood and muscle

From early in the morning ’til way past dark

All you ever do is hustle

All your loved ones have walked out the door

The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes

And ye shall be changed



The past don’t control you

But the future’s like a roulette wheel spinning

Deep down inside

You know you need a whole new beginning

Don’t have to go to Russia or Iran

Just surrender to God and He’ll move you right here where you stand, and



Ye shall be changed, ye shall be changed

In a twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet blows

The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes

And ye shall be changed



You drink bitter water

And you been eating the bread of sorrow

You can’t live for today

When all you’re ever thinking of is tomorrow

The path you’ve endured has been rough

When you’ve decided that you’ve had enough, then

In a twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet blows

The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes

1979,Slow Train Coming,When He Returns,"The iron hand it ain’t no match for the iron rod

The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty God

For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears

It is only He who can reduce me to tears

Don’t you cry and don’t you die and don’t you burn

For like a thief in the night, He’ll replace wrong with right

When He returns



Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through

He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew

How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?

How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?

Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?

Will I ever learn that there’ll be no peace, that the war won’t cease

Until He returns?



Surrender your crown on this blood-stained ground, take off your mask

He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask

How long can you falsify and deny what is real?

How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?

Of every earthly plan that be known to man, He is unconcerned

He’s got plans of His own to set up His throne

When He returns"

Shine your light, shine your light on me

Shine your light, shine your light on me

Ya know I just couldn’t make it by myself

I’m a little too blind to see



My so-called friends have fallen under a spell

They look me squarely in the eye and they say, “All is well”

Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high

When men will beg God to kill them and they won’t be able to die?



Sister, lemme tell you about a vision I saw

You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law

You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him about Mohammed

    in the same breath

You never mentioned one time the Man who came and died a criminal’s death

Precious angel, you believe me when I say

What God has given to us no man can take away

We are covered in blood, girl, you know our forefathers were slaves

Let us hope they’ve found mercy in their bone-filled graves



You’re the queen of my flesh, girl, you’re my woman, you’re my delight

You’re the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night

But there’s violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed

They don’t want me around

They show me to the door

They say don’t come back no more

’Cause I don’t be like they’d like me to

I believe in you even though we be apart

I believe in you even on the morning after

Oh, when the dawn is nearing

Oh, when the night is disappearing

Oh, this feeling is still here in my heart



Don’t let me drift too far

Keep me where you are

Where I will always be renewed

And that which you’ve given me today

Is worth more than I could pay

And no matter what they say

I believe in you



I believe in you when winter turn to summer

I believe in you when white turn to black

I believe in you even though I be outnumbered

Oh, though the earth may shake me

Oh, though my friends forsake me

Oh, even that couldn’t make me go back

Don’t mind the driving rain

I know I will sustain

1980,Too Late,Too Late,"Well, whether there was a murder, I don’t know, I wasn’t there
I was busy visiting a friend in jail
There were just two women on the scene at the time
Neither one of ‘em saw a thing, both of ‘em were wearing veils
They said it was a natural situation
He reached too high and tumbled back to the ground
You know what they say about being nice to people on your way up
“You might meet ‘em again on your way back down”

But it’s too late to bring him back
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late to bring him back

He had a brother named Paul hang out at the cafe royal
Where Miss Dolly plays and the reviews have been mixed
Well, he’s pretty to look at looking for someone to throw the book at
But you know that he drinks and drinks, can’t be fixed
Sing me one more song about your summer romance, I know
You don’t know marvelous children, sing me the one about you and Errol Flynn
In these times of compassion where conformity’s a fashion
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in

But it’s too late to bring him back
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late to bring him back

Dr. Silver Spoon from the empress ballroom
He’s a retired business who feeds off everyone he’s touched
Gives money to the church and foundations for research
He’s not someone you can play around with too much
But then there’s Rosetta Blake who’s been to both sides of the lake
She’s rough to look at but she’s righteously fit
She’ll feed you coconut bread and spiced buns in bed
You won’t have to worry ‘bout sleeping face down with your head in the plate


 
But it’s too late to bring him back
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late to bring him back

You’ll arrange to see your man tonight
Who tells you some secret things you think might open some doors
How to enter the gates of paradise, no not really
More like how to go crazy from carrying a burden that’s never meant to be yours
From the stage they’ll be doing the bumps and the grinds
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand and say thanks
They like to take all this money from sin and build big universities to study in
And sing Amazing Grace all the way to the Swiss Bank

But it’s too late to bring him back
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late to bring him back

They got some serious people out there, man
They can ring your bell and show you how to hold your tongue
They don’t come to party, man
They kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young
They don’t believe in mercy
And judgment on them is something you’ll never see
They can put your face on a postage stamp
Turn your home into an armed camp anyway they want you
That’s the way you’ll be

But it’s too late to bring him back
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late to bring him back

Yes, I loved him too
I still see him in my mind climbing up that hill
Or was it a wall, I don’t recall
It don’t matter at all and it never will
Ain’t nothing left here partner
Just the dust of fools that have left their mark in spades
From now on this will be where you’re from
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come
Feel that hot iron glowing now as you raise the shades

But it’s too late to bring him back
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late to bring him back"

There’s only one road and it leads to Calvary

It gets discouraging at times, but I know I’ll make it

I’ve been broken, shattered like an empty cup

I’m just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up

And I can’t let go, won’t let go and I can’t let go no more



For me He was chastised, for me He was hated

For me He was rejected by a world that He created

Nations are angry, cursed are some

People are expecting a false peace to come



Well, I’m hangin’ on to a solid rock

Made before the foundation of the world

And I won’t let go and I can’t let go, won’t let go

And I can’t let go, won’t let go and I can’t let go no more

Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it

Using all the devices under the sun

And He never give up ’til the battle’s lost or won

Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent

Felt around for the light switch, became nauseated

She was walking down the hallway while the walls deteriorated



West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar

I see the turning of the page

Curtain risin’ on a new age

See the groom still waitin’ at the altar



Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery

Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery

Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me

About the madness of becomin’ what one was never meant to be



West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar

I see the burning of the stage

Curtain risin’ on a new age

See the groom still waitin’ at the altar



Don’t know what I can say about Claudette that wouldn’t come back to haunt me Finally had to give her up ’bout the time she began to want me

But I know God has mercy on them who are slandered and humiliated

I’d a-done anything for that woman if she didn’t make me feel so obligated



West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar

I see the burning of the cage

Curtain risin’ on a new stage

See the groom still waitin’ at the altar



Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?

I see people who are supposed to know better standin’ around like furniture There’s a wall between you and what you want and you got to leap it

Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won’t have the power to keep it



West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar

I see the burning of the stage

Curtain risin’ on a new age

See the groom still waitin’ at the altar



Cities on fire, phones out of order

They’re killing nuns and soldiers, there’s fighting on the border

What can I say about Claudette? Ain’t seen her since January

She could be respectfully married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires



West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar

I see the burning of the stage

1981,"The Bootleg Series, Vol 1-3: Rare & Unreleased 1961-1991",You Changed My Life,"I was listening to the voices of death on parade

Singing about conspiracy, wanted me to be afraid

Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust

Suffered ridicule and wanting to give it all up in disgust



But you changed my life

Came along in a time of strife

In hunger and need, you made my heart bleed

You changed my life



Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired

They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired

You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends

They'll be there when you got something, they'll take it all in the end



But you changed my life

Came along in a time of strife

I was under the gun, clouds blocking the sun

You changed my life



Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal

I do it myself, it's not so unreal

The call of the wild is forever at my door

Wants me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor



But you changed my life

Came along in a time of strife

From silver and gold to what man cannot hold

You changed my life



I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray

I was told I was looking good and to have a nice day

It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite

Eating that absolute garbage while being so discreet



But you changed my life

Came along in a time of strife

From silver and gold to what man cannot hold

You changed my life



You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm

While orphans of man danced to the beat of the palm

Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass

In the world you had made they made you an outcast



You changed my life

Came along in a time of strife

From silver and gold to what man cannot hold

You changed my life



There was someone in my body that I could hardly see

Invading my privacy making my decisions for me

Holding me back, not letting me stand

Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land



But you changed my life

Came along in a time of strife

You come down the line, give me a new mind

You changed my life



My Lord and my Savior, my companion, my friend

Heart fixer, mind regulator, true to the end

My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy

What the world is set against but will never destroy



You changed my life

Came along in a time of strife

You came in like the wind, like Errol Flynn

You changed my life"
1981,Shot of Love,Every Grain of Sand,"In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need

When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed

There’s a dyin’ voice within me reaching out somewhere

Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair



Don’t have the inclination to look back on any mistake

Like Cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break

In the fury of the moment I can see the Master’s hand

In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand



Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear

Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer

The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way

To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay



I gaze into the doorway of temptation’s angry flame

And every time I pass that way I always hear my name

Then onward in my journey I come to understand

That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand



I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night

In the violence of a summer’s dream, in the chill of a wintry light

In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space

In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face



I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea

Sometimes I turn, there’s someone there, other times it’s only me

I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man

Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand"

You got your rabbit’s foot, you got your good-luck charm

But they can’t help you none when there’s trouble



Trouble

Trouble, trouble, trouble

Nothin’ but trouble



Trouble in the water, trouble in the air

Go all the way to the other side of the world, you’ll find trouble there

Revolution even ain’t no solution for trouble



Trouble

Trouble, trouble, trouble

Nothin’ but trouble



Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul

Persecution, execution, governments out of control

You can see the writing on the wall inviting trouble



Trouble

Trouble, trouble, trouble

Nothin’ but trouble



Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground

You ever feel like you’re never alone even when there’s nobody else around?

Since the beginning of the universe man’s been cursed by trouble



Trouble

Trouble, trouble, trouble

Nothin’ but trouble



Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned

Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed

Look into infinity, all you see is trouble



Trouble

Trouble, trouble, trouble

Nothin’ but trouble

1981,Shot of Love,In the Summertime,"I was in your presence for an hour or so

Or was it a day? I truly don’t know

Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low

By that soft and shining sea

Did you respect me for what I did

Or for what I didn’t do, or for keeping it hid?

Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid

Of everything you see?



In the summertime, ah in the summertime

In the summertime, when you were with me



I got the heart and you got the blood

We cut through iron and we cut through mud

Then came the warnin’ that was before the flood

That set everybody free

Fools they made a mock of sin

Our loyalty they tried to win

But you were closer to me than my next of kin

When they didn’t want to know or see



In the summertime, ah in the summertime

In the summertime when you were with me



Strangers, they meddled in our affairs

Poverty and shame was theirs

But all that sufferin’ was not to be compared

With the glory that is to be

And I’m still carrying the gift you gave

It’s a part of me now, it’s been cherished and saved

It’ll be with me unto the grave

And then unto eternity



In the summertime, ah in the summertime

In the summertime when you were with me"
1981,Shot of Love,Lenny Bruce,"Lenny Bruce is dead but his ghost lives on and on

Never did get any Golden Globe award, never made it to Synanon

He was an outlaw, that’s for sure

More of an outlaw than you ever were

Lenny Bruce is gone but his spirit’s livin’ on and on



Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn’t work out

But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talkin’ about

Never robbed any churches nor cut off any babies’ heads

He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds

He’s on some other shore, he didn’t wanna live anymore



Lenny Bruce is dead but he didn’t commit any crime

He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time

I rode with him in a taxi once

Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months

Lenny Bruce moved on and like the ones that killed him, gone



They said that he was sick ’cause he didn’t play by the rules

He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools

They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts

He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts

Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had"

Dead man, dead man

Cobwebs in your mind

Dust upon your eyes



Satan got you by the heel, there’s a bird’s nest in your hair

What are you tryin’ to prove?



Dead man, dead man

The race of the engine that overrules your heart

Pretending that you’re so smart



Dead man, dead man

’Cause he doesn’t tell you jokes or fairy tales, say he’s got no style



He’s the property of Jesus

You can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games

Ain’t no goin’ back



There’s a retired businessman named Red

Cast down from heaven and he’s out of his head

He feeds off of everyone that he can touch

He said he only deals in cash or sells tickets to a plane crash

He’s not somebody that you play around with much

Miss Delilah is his, a Phillistine is what she is

She’ll do wondrous works with your fate, feed you coconut bread,

    spice buns in your bed

If you don’t mind sleepin’ with your head face down in a grave



Well, there ain’t no goin’ back

When your foot of pride come down

Ain’t no goin’ back



Well, they’ll choose a man for you to meet tonight

You’ll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors

How to enter into the gates of paradise

No, how to carry a burden too heavy to be yours

Yeah, from the stage they’ll be tryin’ to get water outa rocks

A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand and say thanks

They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in

Sing “Amazing Grace” all the way to the Swiss banks



Well, there ain’t no goin’ back

When your foot of pride come down

Ain’t no goin’ back



They got some beautiful people out there, man

They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue

They got mystery written all over their forehead

They kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young

They don’t believe in mercy

Judgement on them is something that you’ll never see

They can exalt you up or bring you down main route

Turn you into anything that they want you to be



Well, there ain’t no goin’ back

When your foot of pride come down

Ain’t no goin’ back



Yes, I guess I loved him too

I can still see him in my mind climbin’ that hill

Did he make it to the top, well he probably did and dropped

Struck down by the strength of the will

Ain’t nothin’ left here partner, just the dust of a plague

    that has left this whole town afraid

From now on, this’ll be where you’re from

Let the dead bury the dead. Your time will come

Let hot iron blow as he raised the shade



Well, there ain’t no goin’ back

When your foot of pride come down

Ain’t no goin’ back

He’s got his mother’s eyes

There’s gladness in his heart

He’s young and he’s wild

My only prayer is, if I can’t be there

Lord, protect my child



As his youth now unfolds

He is centuries old

Just to see him at play makes me smile

No matter what happens to me

No matter what my destiny

Lord, protect my child



The whole world is asleep

You can look at it and weep

Few things you find are worthwhile

And though I don’t ask for much

No material things to touch

Lord, protect my child



He’s young and on fire

Full of hope and desire

In a world that’s been raped and defiled

If I fall along the way

And can’t see another day

Lord, protect my child



There’ll be a time I hear tell

When all will be well

When God and man will be reconciled

But until men lose their chains

And righteousness reigns

Lord, protect my child

Does that flame still burn, Does that fire still glow

Or has it died out and melted like the snow

Tell me

Tell me—what are you focused upon

Tell me—will it come to me after you’re gone

Tell me quick with a glance on the side

Shall I hold you close or shall I let you go by

Tell me

Tell me



Are you lookin’ at me and thinking of somebody else

Can you feel the heat and the beat of my pulse

Do you have any secrets

That will only come out in time

Do you lay in bed and stare at the stars

Is your main friend someone who’s an old acquaintance of ours

Tell me

Tell me



Tell me—what’s in back of them pretty brown eyes

Tell me—behind what door your treasure lies

Ever gone broke in a big way

Ever done the opposite of what the experts say

Tell me

Tell me



Is it some kind of game that you’re playin’ with me

Am I imagining something that never can be

Do you have any morals

Do you have any point of view

Is that a smile I see on your face

Will it take you to glory or to disgrace

Tell me

Tell me



Tell me—is my name in your book

Tell me—will you go back and take another look

Tell me the truth, tell me no lies

Are you someone whom anyone prays for or cries

""Take the bull by the horns”

I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns

Everything looks a little far away to me



Gettin’ harder and harder to recognize the trap

Too much information about nothin’

Too much educated rap

It’s just like you told me, just like you said it would be



The moon rising like wildfire

I feel the breath of a storm

Something I got to do tonight

You go inside and stay warm



Someone’s got a hold of my heart

Someone’s got a hold of my heart

Someone’s got a hold of my heart

You—

Yeah, you got a hold of my heart



Just got back from a city of flaming red skies

Everybody thinks with their stomach

There’s plenty of spies

Every street is crooked, they just wind around till they disappear



Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep

Like an ancient river

So wide and deep

She said, “Be easy, baby, ain’t nothin’ worth stealin’ here”



You’re the one I’ve been waitin’ for

You’re the one I desire

But you must first realize

I’m not another man for hire



Someone’s got a hold of my heart

Someone’s got a hold of my heart

Someone’s got a hold of my heart

You, you, you, you

Yeah, you got a hold of my heart



Hear that hot-blooded singer

On the bandstand croon

September song, Memphis in June

While they’re beating the devil out of a guy who’s wearing a powder blue wig



I been to Babylon

I gotta confess

I could still hear the voice crying in the wilderness

What looks large from a distance, close up is never that big

Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine

Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine



Someone’s got a hold of my heart

Someone’s got a hold of my heart

Someone’s got a hold of my heart

You—

Yeah, you got a hold of my heart

By the way, that’s a cute hat

And that smile’s so hard to resist

But what’s a sweetheart like you doin’ in a dump like this?



You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you

She wanted a whole man, not just a half

She used to call me sweet daddy when I was only a child

You kind of remind me of her when you laugh

In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear

It’s done with a flick of the wrist

What’s a sweetheart like you doin’ in a dump like this?

You know you can make a name for yourself

Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal



You know, news of you has come down the line

Even before ya came in the door

They say in your father’s house, there’s many mansions

Each one of them got a fireproof floor

Snap out of it, baby, people are jealous of you

They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss

What’s a sweetheart like you doin’ in a dump like this?



Got to be an important person to be in here, honey

Got to have done some evil deed

Got to have your own harem when you come in the door

Got to play your harp until your lips bleed



They say that patriotism is the last refuge

To which a scoundrel clings

Steal a little and they throw you in jail

Steal a lot and they make you king

There’s only one step down from here, baby

It’s called the land of permanent bliss

What’s a sweetheart like you doin’ in a dump like this?

First step was touching the moon



Now, there’s a woman on my block

She just sit there as the night grows still

Sitting there in a cold chill

She say who gonna take away his license to kill?



Ya may be a noisemaker, spirit maker

Heartbreaker, backbreaker

Leave no stone unturned

May be an actor in a plot

That might be all that you got

Now he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool

And when he sees his reflection, he’s fulfilled

Oh, man is opposed to fair play

He wants it all and he wants it his way

She say who gonna take away his license to kill?

The band is playing “Dixie,” a man got his hand outstretched

Could be the Führer

Could be the local priest

He got a sweet gift of gab, he got a harmonious tongue

He knows every song of love that ever has been sung

Good intentions can be evil

Both hands can be full of grease

You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace



Well, first he’s in the background, then he’s in the front

Both eyes are looking like they’re on a rabbit hunt

Nobody can see through him

No, not even the Chief of Police

Well, he catch you when you’re hoping for a glimpse of the sun

Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton

He could be standing next to you

The person that you’d notice least

I hear that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace



Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull

He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull

I can smell something cooking

I can tell there’s going to be a feast

You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace



He’s a great humanitarian, he’s a great philanthropist

He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed

He’ll put both his arms around you

You can feel the tender touch of the beast

You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace



Well, the howling wolf will howl tonight, the king snake will crawl

Trees that’ve stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall

Wanna get married? Do it now

Tomorrow all activity will cease

You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace



Somewhere Mama’s weeping for her blue-eyed boy

She’s holding them little white shoes and that little broken toy

And he’s following a star

The same one them three men followed from the East

I hear that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

1983,Infields,Don’t Fall Apart on Me Tonight,"Just a minute before you leave, girl

Just a minute before you touch the door

What is it that you’re trying to achieve, girl?

Do you think we can talk about it some more?

You know, the streets are filled with vipers

Who’ve lost all ray of hope

You know, it ain’t even safe no more

In the palace of the Pope



Don’t fall apart on me tonight

I just don’t think that I could handle it

Don’t fall apart on me tonight

Yesterday’s just a memory

Tomorrow is never what it’s supposed to be

And I need you, yeah



Come over here from over there, girl

Sit down here. You can have my chair

I can’t see us goin’ anywhere, girl

The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can’t take you there

I wish I’d have been a doctor

Maybe I’d have saved some life that had been lost

Maybe I’d have done some good in the world

’Stead of burning every bridge I crossed



Don’t fall apart on me tonight

I just don’t think that I could handle it

Don’t fall apart on me tonight

Yesterday’s just a memory

Tomorrow is never what it’s supposed to be

And I need you, oh, yeah



I ain’t too good at conversation, girl

So you might not know exactly how I feel

But if I could, I’d bring you to the mountaintop, girl

And build you a house made out of stainless steel

But it’s like I’m stuck inside a painting

That’s hanging in the Louvre

My throat start to tickle and my nose itches

But I know that I can’t move



Don’t fall apart on me tonight

I just don’t think that I could handle it

Don’t fall apart on me tonight

Yesterday’s gone but the past lives on

Tomorrow’s just one step beyond

And I need you, oh, yeah



Who are these people who are walking towards you?

Do you know them or will there be a fight?

With their humorless smiles so easy to see through

Can they tell you what’s wrong from what’s right?

Do you remember St. James Street

Where you blew Jackie P.’s mind?

You were so fine, Clark Gable would have fell at your feet

And laid his life on the line



Let’s try to get beneath the surface waste, girl

No more booby traps and bombs

No more decadence and charm

No more affection that’s misplaced, girl

No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms

What about that millionaire with the drumsticks in his pants?

He looked so baffled and so bewildered

When he played and we didn’t dance



Don’t fall apart on me tonight

I just don’t think that I could handle it

Don’t fall apart on me tonight

Yesterday’s just a memory

Tomorrow is never what it’s supposed to be

And I need you, yeah"
1983,Infields,I and I,"Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed

Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams

In another lifetime she must have owned the world, or been faithfully wed

To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams



I and I

In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives

I and I

One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives



Think I’ll go out and go for a walk

Not much happenin’ here, nothin’ ever does

Besides, if she wakes up now, she’ll just want me to talk

I got nothin’ to say, ’specially about whatever was



I and I

In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives

I and I

One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives



Took an untrodden path once, where the swift don’t win the race

It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth

Took a stranger to teach me, to look into justice’s beautiful face

And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth



I and I

In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives

I and I

One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives



Outside of two men on a train platform there’s nobody in sight

They’re waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track

The world could come to an end tonight, but that’s all right

She should still be there sleepin’ when I get back



I and I

In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives

I and I

One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives



Noontime, and I’m still pushin’ myself along the road, the darkest part

Into the narrow lanes, I can’t stumble or stay put

Someone else is speakin’ with my mouth, but I’m listening only to my heart

I’ve made shoes for everyone, even you, while I still go barefoot



I and I

In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives

I and I

One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives

By a guy makin’ thirty cents a day

Sure was a good idea

’Til greed got in the way



Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong

And the pearls are from Japan

Well, the dog collar’s from India

And the flower pot’s from Pakistan

You just build it cheaper someplace else



Well, it’s sundown on the union

And what’s made in the U.S.A.

Sure was a good idea

’Til greed got in the way

They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador

The unions are big business, friend

And they’re goin’ out like a dinosaur

Now they want to grow it on the moon and eat it raw

I can see the day coming when even your home garden

Is gonna be against the law



Well, it’s sundown on the union

And what’s made in the U.S.A.

Sure was a good idea

’Til greed got in the way



Democracy don’t rule the world

You’d better get that in your head

This world is ruled by violence

But I guess that’s better left unsaid

From Broadway to the Milky Way

That’s a lot of territory indeed

And a man’s gonna do what he has to do

When he’s got a hungry mouth to feed

He got no allies to really speak of

What he gets he must pay for, he don’t get it out of love

He buys obsolete weapons and he won’t be denied

But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side

He’s the neighborhood bully



Well, he’s surrounded by pacifists who all want peace

They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed must cease

Now, they wouldn’t hurt a fly. To hurt one they would weep

They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep

He’s the neighborhood bully



Every empire that’s enslaved him is gone

Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon

He’s made a garden of paradise in the desert sand

In bed with nobody, under no one’s command

He’s the neighborhood bully



Now his holiest books have been trampled upon

No contract he signed was worth what it was written on

He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth

Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health

He’s the neighborhood bully



What’s anybody indebted to him for?

Nothin’, they say. He just likes to cause war

Pride and prejudice and superstition indeed

They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed

He’s the neighborhood bully



What has he done to wear so many scars?

Does he change the course of rivers? Does he pollute the moon and stars?

Smoke is in your eye, you draw a smile

From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning

You’ve had time to think about it for a while



Well, I’ve walked two hundred miles, now look me over

It’s the end of the chase and the moon is high

It won’t matter who loves who

You’ll love me or I’ll love you

When the night comes falling from the sky



I can see through your walls and I know you’re hurting

Sorrow covers you up like a cape

Only yesterday I know that you’ve been flirting

With disaster that you managed to escape



I can’t provide for you no easy answers

Who are you that I should have to lie?

You’ll know all about it, love

It’ll fit you like a glove

When the night comes falling from the sky



I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river

You must have been protecting someone last time I called.

I’ve never asked you for nothing you couldn’t deliver

I’ve never asked you to set yourself up for a fall



I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness

For the love of a lousy buck, I’ve watched them die

Stick around, baby, we’re not through

Don’t look for me, I’ll see you

When the night comes falling from the sky



In your teardrops, I can see my own reflection

It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line

I don’t want to be a fool starving for affection

I don’t want to drown in someone else’s wine



For all eternity I think I will remember

That icy wind that’s howling in your eye

You will seek me and you’ll find me

In the wasteland of your mind

When the night comes falling from the sky



Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter

But you were gambling for support

This time tomorrow I’ll know you better

When my memory is not so short



This time I’m asking for freedom

Freedom from a world which you deny

And you’ll give it to me now

I’ll take it anyhow

Sorry if I hurt you, baby

Sorry if I did

Sorry if I touched the place

Where your secrets are hid

But you meant more than everything

And I could not pretend

I ain’t never gonna be the same again

The truth that I’m seeking is in your missing file

What’s your position, baby, what’s going on?

Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?



I know everything about this place, or so it seems

Am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?

Even the bloodhounds of London couldn’t find you today

I see the shadow of a man, baby, makin’ you blue

Who is he, baby, and what’s he to you?



We’ve reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins

Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins

But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?

Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?



I can feel it in the night when I think of you

I can feel it in the light and it’s got to be true

You can’t live by bread alone, you won’t be satisfied

You can’t roll away the stone if your hands are tied



Got to start someplace, baby, can you explain?

Please don’t fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train

Answer me, baby, a casual look will do

Just what in the world has come over you?



I can feel it in the wind and it’s upside down

I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town

I’ve had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve

I don’t wanna see you bleed, I know what you need but it ain’t what you deserve

Come baby, teach me, come baby, reach me, let the music start

I could be dreaming but I keep believing you’re the one I’m livin’ for

And I will always be emotionally yours



It’s like my whole life never happened

When I see you, it’s as if I never had a thought

I know this dream, it might be crazy

But it’s the only one I’ve got

Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when

Don’t trust me to show you the truth

When the truth may only be ashes and dust

If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself



Well, you’re on your own, you always were

In a land of wolves and thieves

Don’t put your hope in ungodly man

Or be a slave to what somebody else believes



Trust yourself

And you won’t be disappointed when vain people let you down

Trust yourself

And look not for answers where no answers can be found

Don’t trust me to show you love

When my love may be only lust

If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself"

He was a clean-cut kid

But they made a killer out of him

That’s what they did



He bought the American dream but it put him in debt

The only game he could play was Russian roulette



He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread

Ate Burger Kings, he was well fed



He went to Hollywood to see Peter O’Toole

He stole a Rolls-Royce and drove it in a swimming pool



They took a clean-cut kid

And they made a killer out of him

That’s what they did



He could’ve sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar

Could’ve been an accountant or a tennis star



He was wearing boxing gloves, took a dive one day

Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay



His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans

They gotta sleep together in a home they don’t own



They took a clean-cut kid

And they made a killer out of him

That’s what they did



Well, everybody’s asking why he couldn’t adjust

All he ever wanted was somebody to trust



They took his head and turned it inside out

He never did know what it was all about



He had a steady job, he joined the choir

He never did plan to walk the high wire



They took a clean-cut kid

And they made a killer out of him

That’s what they did"
1985,Empire Burlesque,Seeing the Real You at Last,"Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down

But it looks like it don’t

I’d like to get you to change your mind

But it looks like you won’t



From now on I’ll be busy

Ain’t goin’ nowhere fast

I’m just glad it’s over

And I’m seeing the real you at last



Well, didn’t I risk my neck for you

Didn’t I take chances?

Didn’t I rise above it all for you

The most unfortunate circumstances?



Well, I have had some rotten nights

Didn’t think that they would pass

I’m just thankful and grateful

To be seeing the real you at last



I’m hungry and I’m irritable

And I’m tired of this bag of tricks

At one time there was nothing wrong with me

That you could not fix



Well, I sailed through the storm

Strapped to the mast

But the time has come

And I’m seeing the real you at last



When I met you, baby

You didn’t show no visible scars

You could ride like Annie Oakley

You could shoot like Belle Starr



Well, I don’t mind a reasonable amount of trouble

Trouble always comes to pass

But all I care about now

Is that I’m seeing the real you at last



Well, I’m gonna quit this baby talk now

I guess I should have known

I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles

I think maybe we’d better leave each other alone



Whatever you gonna do

Please do it fast

I’m still trying to get used to

Seeing the real you at last"
1985,Empire Burlesque,Tight Connection to My Heart (Has Anyone Seen My Love)Don’t Fall Apart on Me Tonight,"Well, I had to move fast

And I couldn’t with you around my neck

I said I’d send for you and I did

What did you expect?

My hands are sweating

And we haven’t even started yet

I’ll go along with the charade

Until I can think my way out

I know it was all a big joke

Whatever it was about

Someday maybe

I’ll remember to forget



I’m gonna get my coat

I feel the breath of a storm

There’s something I’ve got to do tonight

You go inside and stay warm



Has anybody seen my love

Has anybody seen my love

Has anybody seen my love

I don’t know

Has anybody seen my love?



You want to talk to me

Go ahead and talk

Whatever you got to say to me

Won’t come as any shock

I must be guilty of something

You just whisper it into my ear

Madame Butterfly

She lulled me to sleep

In a town without pity

Where the water runs deep

She said, “Be easy, baby

There ain’t nothin’ worth stealin’ in here”



You’re the one I’ve been looking for

You’re the one that’s got the key

But I can’t figure out whether I’m too good for you

Or you’re too good for me



Has anybody seen my love

Has anybody seen my love

Has anybody seen my love

I don’t know

Has anybody seen my love?



Well, they’re not showing any lights tonight

And there’s no moon

There’s just a hot-blooded singer

Singing “Memphis in June”

While they’re beatin’ the devil out of a guy

Who’s wearing a powder-blue wig

Later he’ll be shot

For resisting arrest

I can still hear his voice crying

In the wilderness

What looks large from a distance

Close up ain’t never that big



Never could learn to drink that blood

And call it wine

Never could learn to hold you, love

And call you mine"
1985,Empire Burlesque,I’ll Remember You,"I’ll remember you

When I’ve forgotten all the rest

You to me were true

You to me were the best

When there is no more

You cut to the core

Quicker than anyone I knew

When I’m all alone

In the great unknown

I’ll remember you



I’ll remember you

At the end of the trail

I had so much left to do

I had so little time to fail

There’s some people that

You don’t forget

Even though you’ve only seen ’m one time or two

When the roses fade

And I’m in the shade

I’ll remember you



Didn’t I, didn’t I try to love you?

Didn’t I, didn’t I try to care?

Didn’t I sleep, didn’t I weep beside you

With the rain blowing in your hair?



I’ll remember you

When the wind blows through the piney wood

It was you who came right through

It was you who understood

Though I’d never say

That I done it the way

That you’d have liked me to

In the end

My dear sweet friend

I’ll remember you
"
1985,Empire Burlesque,Dark Eyes,"Oh, the gentlemen are talking and the midnight moon is on the riverside

They’re drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide

I live in another world where life and death are memorized

Where the earth is strung with lovers’ pearls and all I see are dark eyes



A cock is crowing far away and another soldier’s deep in prayer

Some mother’s child has gone astray, she can’t find him anywhere

But I can hear another drum beating for the dead that rise

Whom nature’s beast fears as they come and all I see are dark eyes



They tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes

They tell me revenge is sweet and from where they stand, I’m sure it is

But I feel nothing for their game where beauty goes unrecognized

All I feel is heat and flame and all I see are dark eyes



Oh, the French girl, she’s in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel

Hunger pays a heavy price to the falling gods of speed and steel

Oh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that flies

A million faces at my feet but all I see are dark eyes
"
1986,Knocked Out Loaded,Brownsville Girl,"Well, there was this movie I seen one time

About a man riding ’cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck

He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself

The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck



Well, the marshal, now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp

As the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath

“Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square

I want him to feel what it’s like to every moment face his death”



Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in

And you know it blows right through me like a ball and chain

You know I can’t believe we’ve lived so long and are still so far apart

The memory of you keeps callin’ after me like a rollin’ train



I can still see the day that you came to me on the painted desert

In your busted down Ford and your platform heels

I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet

Ah, but you were right. It was perfect as I got in behind the wheel



Well, we drove that car all night into San Anton’

And we slept near the Alamo, your skin was so tender and soft

Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back

I would have gone on after you but I didn’t feel like letting my head get blown off



Well, we’re drivin’ this car and the sun is comin’ up over the Rockies

Now I know she ain’t you but she’s here and she’s got that dark rhythm in her soul

But I’m too over the edge and I ain’t in the mood anymore to remember the times

    when I was your only man

And she don’t want to remind me. She knows this car would go out of control



Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls

Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above

Brownsville girl, show me all around the world

Brownsville girl, you’re my honey love



Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo

We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live. He owned a wreckin’ lot

    outside of town about a mile

Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back.

    She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust

She said, “Henry ain’t here but you can come on in, he’ll be back in a little while”



Then she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinkin’ of

    bummin’ a ride back to from where she started

But ya know, she changed the subject every time money came up

She said, “Welcome to the land of the living dead”

    You could tell she was so broken hearted

She said, “Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt”



“How far are y’all going?” Ruby asked us with a sigh

“We’re going all the way ’til the wheels fall off and burn

’Til the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies”

Ruby just smiled and said, “Ah, you know some babies never learn”



Something about that movie though, well I just can’t get it out of my head

But I can’t remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play

All I remember about it was Gregory Peck and the way people moved

And a lot of them seemed to be lookin’ my way



Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,

Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above

Brownsville girl, show me all around the world

Brownsville girl, you’re my honey love



Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour

I was crossin’ the street when shots rang out

I didn’t know whether to duck or to run, so I ran

“We got him cornered in the churchyard,” I heard somebody shout



Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune. Underneath it,

    it said, “A man with no alibi”

You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you

Then when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears

It was the best acting I saw anybody do



Now I’ve always been the kind of person that doesn’t like to trespass

    but sometimes you just find yourself over the line

Oh if there’s an original thought out there, I could use it right now

You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain’t sayin’ much.

    I could feel a whole lot better

If you were just here by my side to show me how



Well, I’m standin’ in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck

Yeah, but you know it’s not the one that I had in mind

He’s got a new one out now, I don’t even know what it’s about

But I’ll see him in anything so I’ll stand in line



Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls

Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above

Brownsville girl, show me all around the world

Brownsville girl, you’re my honey love



You know, it’s funny how things never turn out the way you had ’em planned

The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter

    is that his name wasn’t Henry Porter

And you know there was somethin’ about you baby that I liked

    that was always too good for this world

Just like you always said there was somethin’ about me you liked

    that I left behind in the French Quarter



Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections

    than people who are most content

I don’t have any regrets, they can talk about me plenty when I’m gone

You always said people don’t do what they believe in,

    they just do what’s most convenient, then they repent

And I always said, “Hang on to me, baby, and let’s hope that the roof stays on”



There was a movie I seen one time, I think I sat through it twice

I don’t remember who I was or where I was bound

All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck, he wore a gun

    and he was shot in the back

Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down



Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls

Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above

Brownsville girl, show me all around the world

Brownsville girl, you’re my honey love"
1986,Knocked Out Loaded,Driftin’ Too Far from Shore,"I didn’t know that you’d be leavin’

I figure maybe we’re even

Or maybe I’m one up on you



I send you all my money

Just like I did before

I tried to reach you honey

But you’re driftin’ too far from shore



Driftin’ too far from shore

Driftin’ too far from shore

Driftin’ too far from shore

Driftin’ too far from shore



I ain’t gonna get lost in this current

I don’t like playing cat and mouse

No gentleman likes making love to a servant

Especially when he’s in his father’s house



I never could guess your weight, baby

Never needed to call you my whore

I always thought you were straight, baby

But you’re driftin’ too far from shore



Driftin’ too far from shore

Driftin’ too far from shore

Driftin’ too far from shore

Driftin’ too far from shore



Well these times and these tunnels are haunted

The bottom of the barrel is too

I waited years sometimes for what I wanted

Everybody can’t be as lucky as you



Never no more do I wonder

Why you don’t never play with me anymore

At any moment you could go under

’Cause you’re driftin’ too far from shore



Driftin’ too far from shore

Driftin’ too far from shore

Driftin’ too far from shore

Driftin’ too far from shore



You and me we had completeness

I give you all of what I could provide

We weren’t on the wrong side, sweetness

We were the wrong side



I’ve already ripped out the phones, honey

You can’t walk the streets in a war

I can finish this alone honey

You’re driftin’ too far from shore

1988,Death Is Not the End,Down in The Groove,"When you’re sad and when you’re lonely

And you haven’t got a friend

Just remember that death is not the end

And all that you’ve held sacred

Falls down and does not mend

Just remember that death is not the end

Not the end, not the end

Just remember that death is not the end



When you’re standing at the crossroads

That you cannot comprehend

Just remember that death is not the end

And all your dreams have vanished

And you don’t know what’s up the bend

Just remember that death is not the end

Not the end, not the end

Just remember that death is not the end



When the storm clouds gather ’round you

And heavy rains descend

Just remember that death is not the end

And there’s no one there to comfort you

With a helpin’ hand to lend

Just remember that death is not the end

Not the end, not the end

Just remember that death is not the end



Oh, the tree of life is growing

Where the spirit never dies

And the bright light of salvation shines

In dark and empty skies



When the cities are on fire

With the burning flesh of men

Just remember that death is not the end

And you search in vain to find

Just one law-abiding citizen

Just remember that death is not the end

Not the end, not the end

Just remember that death is not the end"

When I come knocking don't throw me no bone

I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home

If you don't like it you can leave me alone



I can snap my fingers and require the rain

From a clear blue sky and turn it off again

I can stroke your body and relieve your pain

And charm the whistle off an evening train



I give what I got until I got no more

I take what I get until I even the score

You know I love you and furthermore

When it's time to go you got an open door



I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain

You give something up for everything you gain

Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain

Pay for your ticket and don't complain



One of these days and it won't be long

Going down in the valley and sing my song

I will sing it loud and sing it strong

Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong

1989,Oh Mercy,Ring Them Bells,"Ring them bells, ye heathen

From the city that dreams

Ring them bells from the sanctuaries

’Cross the valleys and streams

For they’re deep and they’re wide

And the world’s on its side

And time is running backwards

And so is the bride



Ring them bells St. Peter

Where the four winds blow

Ring them bells with an iron hand

So the people will know

Oh it’s rush hour now

On the wheel and the plow

And the sun is going down

Upon the sacred cow



Ring them bells Sweet Martha

For the poor man’s son

Ring them bells so the world will know

That God is one

Oh the shepherd is asleep

Where the willows weep

And the mountains are filled

With lost sheep



Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf

Ring them bells for all of us who are left

Ring them bells for the chosen few

Who will judge the many when the game is through

Ring them bells, for the time that flies

For the child that cries

When innocence dies



Ring them bells St. Catherine

From the top of the room

Ring them from the fortress

For the lilies that bloom

Oh the lines are long

And the fighting is strong

And they’re breaking down the distance

Between right and wrong

1989,Oh Mercy,Man in the Long Black Coat,"Crickets are chirpin’, the water is high

There’s a soft cotton dress on the line hangin’ dry

Window wide open, African trees

Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze

Not a word of goodbye, not even a note

She gone with the man

In the long black coat



Somebody seen him hanging around

At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town

He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask

If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask

Somebody said from the Bible he’d quote

There was dust on the man

In the long black coat



Preacher was a talkin’, there’s a sermon he gave

He said ""Every man’s conscience is vile and depraved

You cannot depend on it to be your guide

When it’s you who must keep it satisfied.""

It ain’t easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat

She gave her heart to the man

In the long black coat



There are no mistakes in life some people say

And it's true sometimes you can see it that way

I went down to the river but I just missed the boat

She went with the man

In the long black coat



There’s smoke on the water, it’s been there since June

Tree trunks uprooted, 'neath the high crescent moon

Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force

Somebody is out there beating a dead horse

She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote

She went with the man

In the long black coat

1989,"The Bootleg Series, Vol 1-3: Rare & Unreleased 1961-1991",Series of Dreams,"I was thinking of a series of dreams

Where nothing comes up to the top

Everything stays down where it’s wounded

And comes to a permanent stop

Wasn’t thinking of anything specific

Like in a dream, when someone wakes up and screams

Nothing too very scientific

Just thinking of a series of dreams



Thinking of a series of dreams

Where the time and the tempo fly

And there’s no exit in any direction

’Cept the one that you can’t see with your eyes

Wasn’t making any great connection

Wasn’t falling for any intricate scheme

Nothing that would pass inspection

Just thinking of a series of dreams



Dreams where the umbrella is folded

Into the path you are hurled

And the cards are no good that you’re holding

Unless they’re from another world



In one, numbers were burning

In another, I witnessed a crime

In one, I was running, and in another

All I seemed to be doing was climb

Wasn’t looking for any special assistance

Not going to any great extremes

I’d already gone the distance

Just thinking of a series of dreams"
1989,Oh Mercy,Political World,"We live in a political world

Love don’t have any place

We’re living in times where men commit crimes

And crime don’t have a face



We live in a political world

Icicles hanging down

Wedding bells ring and angels sing

Clouds cover up the ground



We live in a political world

Wisdom is thrown into jail

It rots in a cell, is misguided as hell

Leaving no one to pick up a trail



We live in a political world

Where mercy walks the plank

Life is in mirrors, death disappears

Up the steps into the nearest bank



We live in a political world

Where courage is a thing of the past

Houses are haunted, children are unwanted

The next day could be your last



We live in a political world

The one we can see and can feel

But there’s no one to check, it’s all a stacked deck

We all know for sure that it’s real



We live in a political world

In the cities of lonesome fear

Little by little you turn in the middle

But you’re never sure why you’re here



We live in a political world

Under the microscope

You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there

You always got more than enough rope



We live in a political world

Turning and a-thrashing about

As soon as you’re awake, you’re trained to take

What looks like the easy way out



We live in a political world

Where peace is not welcome at all

It’s turned away from the door to wander some more

Or put up against the wall



We live in a political world

Everything is hers or his

Climb into the frame and shout God’s name

But you’re never sure what it is

1989,Oh Mercy,Where Teardrops Fall,"Far away where the soft winds blow

Far away from it all

There is a place you go

Where teardrops fall



Far away in the stormy night

Far away and over the wall

You are there in the flickering light

Where teardrops fall



We banged the drum slowly

And played the fife lowly

You know the song in my heart

In the turning of twilight

In the shadows of moonlight

You can show me a new place to start



I’ve torn my clothes and I’ve drained the cup

Strippin’ away at it all

Thinking of you when the sun comes up

Where teardrops fall



By rivers of blindness

In love and with kindness

We could hold up a toast if we meet

To the cuttin’ of fences

To sharpen the senses

That linger in the fireball heat



Roses are red, violets are blue

And time is beginning to crawl

I just might have to come see you

Where teardrops fall"

If I just turn away, when I see how you’re dressed

If I shut myself off so I can’t hear you cry

What good am I?



What good am I if I know and don’t do

If I see and don’t say, if I look right through you

If I turn a deaf ear to the thunderin’ sky

What good am I?



What good am I while you softly weep

And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep

And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don’t try

What good am I?



What good am I then to others and me

If I’ve had every chance and yet still fail to see

If my hands are tied must I not wonder within

Who tied them and why and where must I have been?



What good am I if I say foolish things

And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings

And I just turn my back while you silently die

What good am I?

I can handle whatever I stumble upon

Most of the time

My head is on straight

Most of the time

I’m strong enough not to hate

I don’t build up illusion ’til it makes me sick

I ain’t afraid of confusion no matter how thick

I can smile in the face of mankind

Don’t even remember what her lips felt like on mine

Most of the time



Most of the time

She ain’t even in my mind

I wouldn’t know her if I saw her

She’s that far behind

Most of the time

I can’t even be sure

If she was ever with me

Or if I was with her



Most of the time

I’m halfway content

Most of the time

I know exactly where it went

I don’t cheat on myself, I don’t run and hide

Hide from the feelings that are buried inside

I don’t compromise and I don’t pretend

I don’t even care if I ever see her again

Broken idols, broken heads

People sleeping in broken beds

Ain’t no use jiving, ain’t no use joking

Everything is broken



Broken bottles, broken plates

Broken switches, broken gates

Broken dishes, broken parts

Streets are filled with broken hearts

Broken words never meant to be spoken

Everything is broken



Seem like every time you stop and turn around

Something else just hit the ground



Broken cutters, broken saws

Broken buckles, broken laws

Broken bodies, broken bones

Broken voices on broken phones

Take a deep breath, feel like you’re chokin'

Everything is broken



Every time you leave and go off someplace

Things fall to pieces in my face



Broken hands on broken ploughs

Broken treaties, broken vows

Broken pipes, broken tools

People bending broken rules

Hound dog howling, bullfrog croaking

Everything is broken

1989,Oh Mercy,What Was It You Wanted?,"What was it you wanted?

Tell me again so I’ll know

What’s happening in there

What’s going on in your show

What was it you wanted

Could you say it again?

I’ll be back in a minute

You can get it together by then



What was it you wanted

You can tell me, I’m back

We can start it all over

Get it back on the track

You got my attention

Go ahead, speak

What was it you wanted

When you were kissing my cheek?



Was there somebody looking

When you give me that kiss

Someone there in the shadows

Someone that I might have missed?

Is there something you needed

Something I don’t understand

What was it you wanted

Do I have it here in my hand?



Whatever you wanted

Slipped out of my mind

Would you remind me again

If you’d be so kind

Has the record been breaking

Did the needle just skip

Is there somebody waiting

Was there a slip of the lip?



What was it you wanted

I ain’t keeping score

Are you the same person

That was here before?

Is it something important?

Maybe not

What was it you wanted?

Tell me again I forgot



Whatever you wanted

What could it be

Did somebody tell you

That you could get it from me

Is it something that comes natural

Is it easy to say

Why do you want it

Who are you anyway?



Is the scenery changing

Am I getting it wrong

Is the whole thing going backwards

Are they playing our song?

Where were you when it started

Do you want it for free

What was it you wanted

Are you talking to me?"
1989,Oh Mercy,Shooting Star,"Seen a shooting star tonight

And I thought of you

You were trying to break into another world

A world I never knew

I always kind of wondered

If you ever made it through

Seen a shooting star tonight

And I thought of you



Seen a shooting star tonight

And I thought of me

If I was still the same

If I ever became what you wanted me to be

Did I miss the mark or overstep the line

That only you could see?

Seen a shooting star tonight

And I thought of me



Listen to the engine, listen to the bell

As the last fire truck from hell

Goes rolling by

All good people are praying

It’s the last temptation, the last account

The last time you might hear the sermon on the mount

The last radio is playing



Seen a shooting star tonight

Slip away

Tomorrow will be

Another day

Guess it’s too late to say the things to you

That you needed to hear me say

Seen a shooting star tonight

Slip away
"
1990,Under the Red Sky,T.V. Talkin’ Song,"One time in London I’d gone out for a walk

Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk

’Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view

To anyone passing by, that’s who they’re talking to



There was someone on a platform talking to the folks

About the T.V. god and all the pain that it invokes

“It’s too bright a light,” he said, “for anybody’s eyes

If you’ve never seen one it’s a blessing in disguise”



I moved in closer, got up on my toes

Two men in front of me were coming to blows

The man was saying something ’bout children when they’re young

Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung



“The news of the day is on all the time

All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme

Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free

Don’t let an egg get laid in it by something you can’t see”



“Pray for peace!” he said. You could feel it in the crowd

My thoughts began to wander. His voice was ringing loud

“It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone

No one can protect you from it once you turn it on”



“It will lead you into some strange pursuits

Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits

It will scramble up your head and drag your brain about

Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out”



“It’s all been designed,” he said, “to make you lose your mind

And when you go back to find it, there’s nothing there to find

Every time you look at it, your situation’s worse

If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse""



The crowd began to riot and they grabbed hold of the man

There was pushing, there was shoving and everybody ran

The T.V. crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me

Later on that evening, I watched it on T.V.

1990,Under the Red Sky,Under the Red Sky,"There was a little boy and there was a little girl

And they lived in an alley under the red sky

There was a little boy and there was a little girl

And they lived in an alley under the red sky



There was an old man and he lived in the moon

One summer’s day he came passing by

There was an old man and he lived in the moon

And one day he came passing by



Someday little girl, everything for you is gonna be new

Someday little girl, you’ll have a diamond as big as your shoe



Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high

One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie

Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high

One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie



This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town

This is the blind horse that leads you around



Let the bird sing, let the bird fly

One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry

Let the bird sing, let the bird fly

The man in the moon went home and the river went dry

1990,Under the Red Sky,Unbelievable,"It’s unbelievable, it’s strange but true

It’s inconceivable it could happen to you

You go north and you go south

Just like bait in the fish’s mouth

Ya must be livin’ in the shadow of some kind of evil star

It’s unbelievable it would get this far



It’s undeniable what they’d have you to think

It’s indescribable, it can drive you to drink

They said it was the land of milk and honey

Now they say it’s the land of money

Who ever thought they could ever make that stick

It’s unbelievable you can get this rich this quick



Every head is so dignified

Every moon is so sanctified

Every urge is so satisfied as long as you’re with me

All the silver, all the gold

All the sweethearts you can hold

That don’t come back with stories untold

Are hanging on a tree



It’s unbelievable like a lead balloon

It’s so impossible to even learn the tune

Kill that beast and feed that swine

Scale that wall and smoke that vine

Feed that horse and saddle up the drum

It’s unbelievable, the day would finally come



Once there was a man who had no eyes

Every lady in the land told him lies

He stood beneath the silver sky and his heart began to bleed

Every brain is civilized

Every nerve is analyzed

Everything is criticized when you are in need



It’s unbelievable, it’s fancy-free

So interchangeable, so delightful to see

Turn your back, wash your hands

There’s always someone who understands

It don’t matter no more what you got to say

It’s unbelievable it would go down this way

"
1990,Under the Red Sky,Born in Time,"In the lonely night

In the blinking stardust of a pale blue light

You’re comin’ thru to me in black and white

When we were made of dreams



You’re blowing down the shaky street

You’re hearing my heart beat

In the record-breaking heat

Where we were born in time



Not one more night, not one more kiss

Not this time baby, no more of this

Takes too much skill, takes too much will

It’s revealing

You came, you saw, just like the law

You married young, just like your ma

You tried and tried, you made me slide

You left me reelin’ with this feelin’



On the rising curve

Where the ways of nature will test every nerve

You won’t get anything you don’t deserve

Where we were born in time



You pressed me once, you pressed me twice

You hang the flame, you’ll pay the price

Oh babe, that fire

Is still smokin’

You were snow, you were rain

You were striped, you were plain

Oh babe, truer words

Have not been spoken or broken



In the hills of mystery

In the foggy web of destiny

You can have what’s left of me

Where we were born in time

1990,Under the Red Sky,2 X 2,"One by one, they followed the sun

One by one, until there were none

Two by two, to their lovers they flew

Two by two, into the foggy dew

Three by three, they danced on the sea

Four by four, they danced on the shore

Five by five, they tried to survive

Six by six, they were playing with tricks



How many paths did they try and fail?

How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?

How much poison did they inhale?

How many black cats crossed their trail?



Seven by seven, they headed for heaven

Eight by eight, they got to the gate

Nine by nine, they drank the wine

Ten by ten, they drank it again



How many tomorrows have they given away?

How many compared to yesterday?

How many more without any reward?

How many more can they afford?



Two by two, they stepped into the ark

Two by two, they step in the dark

Three by three, they’re turning the key

Four by four, they turn it some more



One by one, they follow the sun

Two by two, to another rendezvous"

Hollow man lookin’ in a cottonfield

Wise man lookin’ in a blade of grass

Young man lookin’ in the shadows that pass

Poor man lookin’ through painted glass

For dignity



Somebody got murdered on New Year’s Eve

Somebody said dignity was the first to leave

I went into the city, went into the town

Went into the land of the midnight sun



Searchin’ high, searchin’ low

Searchin’ everywhere I know

Askin’ the cops wherever I go

Have you seen dignity?



Blind man breakin’ out of a trance

Puts both his hands in the pockets of chance

Hopin’ to find one circumstance

Of dignity



I went to the wedding of Mary Lou

She said, “I don’t want nobody see me talkin’ to you”

Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew

About dignity



I went down where the vultures feed

I would’ve gone deeper, but there wasn’t any need

Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men

Wasn’t any difference to me



Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade

House on fire, debts unpaid

Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid

Have you seen dignity?



Drinkin’ man listens to the voice he hears

In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors

Lookin’ into the lost forgotten years

For dignity



Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues

Said he’d give me information if his name wasn’t used

He wanted money up front, said he was abused

By dignity



Footprints runnin’ ’cross the silver sand

Steps goin’ down into tattoo land

I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light

In the bordertowns of despair



Got no place to fade, got no coat

I’m on the rollin’ river in a jerkin’ boat

Tryin’ to read a note somebody wrote

About dignity



Sick man lookin’ for the doctor’s cure

Lookin’ at his hands for the lines that were

And into every masterpiece of literature

For dignity



Englishman stranded in the blackheart wind

Combin’ his hair back, his future looks thin

Bites the bullet and he looks within

For dignity



Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed

Dignity never been photographed

I went into the red, went into the black

Into the valley of dry bone dreams



So many roads, so much at stake

So many dead ends, I’m at the edge of the lake

Sometimes I wonder what it’s gonna take

To find dignity"
1997,Time out of Mind,Not Dark Yet,"Shadows are falling and I’ve been here all day

It’s too hot to sleep, time is running away

Feel like my soul has turned into steel

I’ve still got the scars that the sun didn’t heal

There’s not even room enough to be anywhere

It’s not dark yet, but it’s getting there



Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain

Behind every beautiful thing there’s been some kind of pain

She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind

She put down in writing what was in her mind

I just don’t see why I should even care

It’s not dark yet, but it’s getting there



Well, I’ve been to London and I’ve been to gay Paree

I’ve followed the river and I got to the sea

I’ve been down on the bottom of a world full of lies

I ain’t looking for nothing in anyone’s eyes

Sometimes my burden seems more than I can bear

It’s not dark yet, but it’s getting there



I was born here and I’ll die here against my will

I know it looks like I’m moving, but I’m standing still

Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb

I can’t even remember what it was I came here to get away from

Don’t even hear a murmur of a prayer

It’s not dark yet, but it’s getting there"
1997,Time out of Mind,Standing in the Doorway,"I’m walking through the summer nights

Jukebox playing low

Yesterday everything was going too fast

Today, it’s moving too slow

I got no place left to turn

I got nothing left to burn

Don’t know if I saw you, if I would kiss you or kill you

It probably wouldn’t matter to you anyhow

You left me standing in the doorway crying

I got nothing to go back to now



The light in this place is so bad

Making me sick in the head

All the laughter is just making me sad

The stars have turned cherry red

I’m strumming on my gay guitar

Smoking a cheap cigar

The ghost of our old love has not gone away

Don’t look like it will anytime soon

You left me standing in the doorway crying

Under the midnight moon



Maybe they’ll get me and maybe they won’t

But not tonight and it won’t be here

There are things I could say but I don’t

I know the mercy of God must be near

I’ve been riding the midnight train

Got ice water in my veins

I would be crazy if I took you back

It would go up against every rule

You left me standing in the doorway crying

Suffering like a fool



When the last rays of daylight go down

Buddy, you’ll roll no more

I can hear the church bells ringing in the yard

I wonder who they’re ringing for

I know I can’t win

But my heart just won’t give in

Last night I danced with a stranger

But she just reminded me you were the one

You left me standing in the doorway crying

In the dark land of the sun



I’ll eat when I’m hungry, drink when I’m dry

And live my life on the square

And even if the flesh falls off of my face

I know someone will be there to care

It always means so much

Even the softest touch

I see nothing to be gained by any explanation

There are no words that need to be said

You left me standing in the doorway crying

Blues wrapped around my head

1997,Time out of Mind,Million Miles,"You took a part of me that I really miss

I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this

You told yourself a lie, that’s all right mama I told myself one too

I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you



You took the silver, you took the gold

You left me standing out in the cold

People ask about you, I didn’t tell them everything I knew

Well, I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you



I’m drifting in and out of dreamless sleep

Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep

Did so many things I never did intend to do

Well, I’m tryin’ to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you



I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low

I need every bit of it for the places that I go

Sometimes I wonder just what it’s all coming to

Well, I’m tryin’ to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you



Well, I don’t dare close my eyes and I don’t dare wink

Maybe in the next life I’ll be able to hear myself think

Feel like talking to somebody but I just don’t know who

Well, I’m tryin’ to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you



The last thing you said before you hit the street

“Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet”

I said, “That’s all right, you do what you gotta do”

Well, I’m tryin’ to get closer, I’m still a million miles from you



Rock me, pretty baby, rock me ’til everything gets real

Rock me for a little while, rock me ’til there’s nothing left to feel

And I’ll rock you too

I’m tryin’ to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you



Well, there’s voices in the night trying to be heard

I’m sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word

I know plenty of people who would put me up for a day or two

Yes, I’m tryin’ to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

1997,Time out of Mind,Tryin’ to Get to Heaven,"The air is getting hotter

There’s a rumbling in the skies

I’ve been wading through the high muddy water

With the heat rising in my eyes

Every day your memory grows dimmer

It doesn’t haunt me like it did before

I’ve been walking through the middle of nowhere

Trying to get to heaven before they close the door



When I was in Missouri

They would not let me be

I had to leave there in a hurry

I only saw what they let me see

You broke a heart that loved you

Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore

I’ve been walking that lonesome valley

Trying to get to heaven before they close the door



People on the platforms

Waiting for the trains

I can hear their hearts a-beatin’

Like pendulums swinging on chains

I tried to give you everything

That your heart was longing for

I’m just going down the road feeling bad

Trying to get to heaven before they close the door



I’m going down the river

Down to New Orleans

They tell me everything is gonna be all right

But I don’t know what “all right” even means

I was riding in a buggy with Miss Mary-Jane

Miss Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore

I been all around the world, boys

Now I’m trying to get to heaven before they close the door



Gonna sleep down in the parlor

And relive my dreams

I’ll close my eyes and I wonder

If everything is as hollow as it seems

When you think that you’ve lost everything

You find out you can always lose a little more

I been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down

Now I’m trying to get to heaven before they close the door"
1997,Time out of Mind,‘Til I Fell in Love with You,"Well, my nerves are exploding and my body’s tense

I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence

I’ve been hit too hard, I’ve seen too much

Nothing can heal me now, but your touch

I don’t know what I’m gonna do

I was all right ’til I fell in love with you



Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky

I thought it would rain but the clouds passed by

Now I feel like I’m coming to the end of my way

But I know God is my shield and he won’t lead me astray

Still I don’t know what I’m gonna do

I was all right ’til I fell in love with you



Boys in the street beginning to play

Girls like birds flying away

When I’m gone you will remember my name

I’m gonna win my way to wealth and fame

I don’t know what I’m gonna do

I was all right ’til I fell in love with you



Junk is piling up, taking up space

My eyes feel like they’re falling off my face

Sweat falling down, I’m staring at the floor

I’m thinking about that girl who won’t be back no more

I don’t know what I’m gonna do

I was all right ’til I fell in love with you



Well, I’m tired of talking, I’m tired of trying to explain

My attempts to please you were all in vain

Tomorrow night before the sun goes down

If I’m still among the living, I’ll be Dixie bound

I just don’t know what I’m gonna do

I was all right ’til I fell in love with you

1997,Time out of Mind,Can’t Wait,"I can’t wait, wait for you to change your mind

It’s late, I’m trying to walk the line

Well, it’s way past midnight and there are people all around

Some on their way up, some on their way down

The air burns and I’m trying to think straight

And I don’t know how much longer I can wait



I’m your man, I’m trying to recover the sweet love that we knew

You understand that my heart can’t go on beating without you

Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I’m reeling from the blow

I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so

I’m breathing hard, standing at the gate

But I don’t know how much longer I can wait



Skies are grey, I’m looking for anything that will bring a happy glow

Night or day, it doesn’t matter where I go anymore, I just go

If I ever saw you coming I don’t know what I would do

I’d like to think I could control myself, but it isn’t true

That’s how it is when things disintegrate

And I don’t know how much longer I can wait



I’m doomed to love you, I’ve been rolling through stormy weather

I’m thinking of you and all the places we could roam together



It’s mighty funny, the end of time has just begun

Oh, honey, after all these years you’re still the one

While I’m strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind

I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line

I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate

But I don’t know how much longer I can wait

1997,Time out of Mind,Highlands,"Well my heart’s in the Highlands, gentle and fair

Honeysuckle blooming in the wildwood air

Bluebelles blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow

Well my heart’s in the Highland

I’m gonna go there when I feel good enough to go



Windows were shakin’ all night in my dreams

Everything was exactly the way that it seems

Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page

Same ol’ rat race

Life in the same ol’ cage



I don’t want nothing from anyone, ain’t that much to take

Wouldn’t know the difference between a real blonde and a fake

Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery

I wish someone would come

And push back the clock for me



Well my heart’s in the Highlands wherever I roam

That’s where I’ll be when I get called home

The wind, it whispers to the buckeyed trees in rhyme

Well my heart’s in the Highlands

I can only get there one step at a time



I’m listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound

Someone’s always yelling turn it down

Feel like I’m drifting

Drifting from scene to scene

I’m wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean?



Insanity is smashing up against my soul

You can say I was on anything but a roll

If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top

What would I do with it anyway

Maybe take it to the pawn shop



My heart’s in the Highlands at the break of dawn

By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan

Big white clouds like chariots that swing down low

Well my heart’s in the Highlands

Only place left to go



I’m in Boston town, in some restaurant

I got no idea what I want

Well, maybe I do but I’m just really not sure

Waitress comes over

Nobody in the place but me and her



It must be a holiday, there’s nobody around

She studies me closely as I sit down

She got a pretty face and long white shiny legs

She says, “What’ll it be?”

I say, “I don’t know, you got any soft boiled eggs?”



She looks at me, says, “I’d bring you some

But we’re out of ’m, you picked the wrong time to come”

Then she says, “I know you’re an artist, draw a picture of me!”

I say, “I would if I could, but

I don’t do sketches from memory”



“Well,” she says, “I’m right here in front of you, or haven’t you looked?”

I say, “All right, I know, but I don’t have my drawing book!”

She gives me a napkin, she says, “You can do it on that”

I say, “Yes I could, but

I don’t know where my pencil is at!”



She pulls one out from behind her ear

She says, “All right now, go ahead, draw me, I’m standing right here”

I make a few lines and I show it for her to see

Well she takes the napkin and throws it back

And says, “That don’t look a thing like me!”



I said, “Oh, kind Miss, it most certainly does”

She says, “You must be jokin’.” I say, “I wish I was!”

Then she says, “You don’t read women authors, do you?”

Least that’s what I think I hear her say

“Well,” I say, “how would you know and what would it matter anyway?”



“Well,” she says, “you just don’t seem like you do!”

I said, “You’re way wrong”

She says, “Which ones have you read then?” I say, “I read Erica Jong!”

She goes away for a minute

And I slide up out of my chair

I step outside back to the busy street but nobody’s going anywhere



Well my heart’s in the Highlands with the horses and hounds

Way up in the border country, far from the towns

With the twang of the arrow and a snap of the bow

My heart’s in the Highlands

Can’t see any other way to go



Every day is the same thing out the door

Feel further away then ever before

Some things in life, it gets too late to learn

Well, I’m lost somewhere

I must have made a few bad turns



I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes

They’re drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes

All the young men with their young women looking so good

Well, I’d trade places with any of them

In a minute, if I could



I’m crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog

Talking to myself in a monologue

I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat

Somebody just asked me

If I registered to vote



The sun is beginning to shine on me

But it’s not like the sun that used to be

The party’s over and there’s less and less to say

I got new eyes

Everything looks far away



Well, my heart’s in the Highlands at the break of day

Over the hills and far away

There’s a way to get there and I’ll figure it out somehow

But I’m already there in my mind

And that’s good enough for now"
1997,Time out of Mind,Love Sick,"I’m walking through streets that are dead

Walking, walking with you in my head

My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired

And the clouds are weeping



Did I hear someone tell a lie?

Did I hear someone’s distant cry?

You thrilled me to my heart, then you ripped it all apart

You went through my pockets when I was sleeping



I’m sick of love…but I’m in the thick of it

This kind of love…I’m so sick of it



I see lovers in the meadow

I see silhouettes in the window

I watch them ’til they’re gone and they leave me hanging on

To a shadow



I’m sick of love…I hear the clock tick

This kind of love…I’m love sick



Sometimes the silence can be like the thunder

Sometimes I feel like I’m being plowed under

Could you ever be true? I think of you

And I wonder



I’m sick of love…I wish I’d never met you

I’m sick of love…I’m trying to forget you



Just don’t know what to do

I’d give anything to be with you"

Gon’ walk down that dirt road, ’til someone lets me ride

If I can’t find my baby, I’m gonna run away and hide



I been pacing around the room hoping maybe she’d come back

Pacing ’round the room hoping maybe she’d come back

Well, I been praying for salvation laying ’round in a one-room country shack



Gon’ walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed

Gon’ walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed

’Til there’s nothing left to see, ’til the chains have been shattered and I’ve been freed



I been lookin’ at my shadow, I been watching the colors up above

Lookin’ at my shadow, watching the colors up above

Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love



Gon’ walk on down that dirt road ’til I’m right beside the sun

Gon’ walk on down until I’m right beside the sun

I’m gonna have to put up a barrier to keep myself away from everyone"

I’m waist deep, waist deep in the mist

It’s almost like, almost like I don’t exist

I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound



The walls of pride are high and wide

Can’t see over to the other side

It’s such a sad thing to see beauty decay

It’s sadder still to feel your heart torn away



One look at you and I’m out of control

Like the universe has swallowed me whole

I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound



There’s too many people, too many to recall

I thought some of ’m were friends of mine, I was wrong about ’m all

I found my world, found my world in you

But your love just hasn’t proved true

I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound

Twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound



Oh, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds

Reality has always had too many heads

Some things last longer than you think they will

There are some kind of things you can never kill



It’s you and you only I been thinking about

But you can’t see in and it’s hard lookin’ out

I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound



Well the fat’s in the fire and the water’s in the tank

The whiskey’s in the jar and the money’s in the bank

I tried to love and protect you because I cared

I’m gonna remember forever the joy that we shared



Looking at you and I’m on my bended knee

You have no idea what you do to me

I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound

Twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound

2001,“Love and Theft”,Moonlight,"The seasons they are turnin’

And my sad heart is yearnin’

To hear again the songbird’s sweet melodious tone

Meet me in the moonlight alone



The dusky light, the day is losing

Orchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan

The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone

Meet me in the moonlight alone



The air is thick and heavy

All along the levee

Where the geese into the countryside have flown

Meet me in the moonlight alone



Well, I’m preachin’ peace and harmony

The blessings of tranquility

Floating like a dream across the floor

I’ll take you ’cross the river dear

You’ve no need to linger here

Draw the blinds, step outside the door



The clouds are turnin’ crimson

The leaves fall from the limbs an’

The branches cast their shadows over stone

Meet me in the moonlight alone



The boulevards of Cypress trees

The masquerades of birds and bees

The petals, pink and white, the wind has blown

Meet me in the moonlight alone



The trailing moss and mystic glow

Purple blossoms soft as snow

Step up and drop the coin right into the slot

The fading light of sunset glowed

It’s crowded on the narrow road

Who cares whether you forgive me or not



My pulse is runnin’ through my palm

The sharp hills are rising from

The yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan

Meet me in the moonlight alone

I’m paintin’ the town making my last go-round



Well, I’m slippin’ and slidin’, walkin’ on briars

To get to the one that my heart desires



I’m rollin’ slow—I’m doing all I know

I’m tellin’ myself I found true happiness

That I’ve still got a dream that hasn’t been repossessed

I’m rollin’ slow, goin’ where the wild red roses grow



Well the future for me is already a thing of the past

You were my first love and you will be my last

Some of these women they just give me the creeps

I’m avoidin’ the Southside the best I can

These memories I got, they can strangle a man

Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night

Lot of things can get in the way when you’re tryin’ to do what’s right

You don’t understand it—my feelings for you

You’d be honest with me if only you knew



I’m not sorry for nothin’ I’ve done

I’m glad I fought—I only wish we’d won

The Siamese twins are comin’ to town

People can’t wait—they’re gathered around

When I left my home the sky split open wide

I never wanted to go back there—I’d rather have died

You don’t understand it—my feelings for you

You’d be honest with me if only you knew



My woman got a face like a teddy bear

She’s tossin’ a baseball bat in the air

The meat is so tough you can’t cut it with a sword

I’m crashin’ my car, trunk first into the boards

You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice

Well, I’ll sell it to ya at a reduced price

You don’t understand it—my feelings for you

You’d be honest with me if only you knew



Some things are too terrible to be true

I won’t come here no more if it bothers you

The Southern Pacific leaving at nine forty-five

I’m having a hard time believin’ some people were ever alive

I’m stark naked, but I don’t care

I’m going off into the woods, I’m huntin’ bare

You don’t understand it—my feelings for you

Well, you’d be honest with me if only you knew



I’m here to create the new imperial empire

I’m going to do whatever circumstances require

I care so much for you—didn’t think that I could

I can’t tell my heart that you’re no good

Well, my parents they warned me not to waste my years

And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears

You don’t understand it—my feelings for you

Well, you’d be honest with me if only you knew

2006,Modern Times,Ain’t Talkin’,"As I walked out tonight in the mystic garden

The wounded flowers were dangling from the vines

I was passing by yon cool and crystal fountain

Someone hit me from behind



Ain’t talkin’, just walkin’

Through this weary world of woe

Heart burnin’, still yearnin’

No one on earth would ever know



They say prayer has the power to help

So pray for me mother

In the human heart an evil spirit can dwell

I’m trying to love my neighbor and do good unto others

But oh, mother, things ain’t going well



Ain’t talkin’, just walkin’

I’ll burn that bridge before you can cross

Heart burnin’, still yearnin’

They’ll be no mercy for you once you’ve lost



Now I’m all worn down by weepin’

My eyes are filled with tears, my lips are dry

If I catch my opponents ever sleepin’

I’ll just slaughter them where they lie



Ain’t talkin’, just walkin’

Through a world mysterious and vague

Heart burnin’, still yearnin’

Walking through the cities of the plague



The whole world is filled with speculation

The whole wide world which people say is round

They will tear your mind away from contemplation

They will jump on your misfortune when you’re down



Ain’t talkin’, just walkin’

Eatin’ hog-eyed grease in hog-eyed town

Heart burnin’, still yearnin’

Someday you’ll be glad to have me around



They will crush you with wealth and power

Every waking moment you could crack

I’ll make the most of one last extra hour

I’ll avenge my father’s death then I’ll step back



Ain’t talkin’, just walkin’

Hand me down my walkin’ cane

Heart burnin’, still yearnin’

Got to get you out of my miserable brain



It’s bright in the heavens and the wheels are flying

Fame and honor never seem to fade

The fire’s gone out but the light is never dying

Who says I can’t get heavenly aid?



Ain’t talkin’, just walkin’

Carrying a dead man’s shield

Heart burnin’, still yearnin’

Walkin’ with a toothache in my heel



The suffering is unending

Every nook and cranny has its tears

I’m not playing, I’m not pretending

I’m not nursing any superfluous fears



Ain’t talkin’, just walkin’

Walkin’ ever since the other night

Heart burnin’, still yearnin’

Walkin’ ’til I’m clean out of sight



As I walked out in the mystic garden

On a hot summer day, hot summer lawn

Excuse me, ma’am, I beg your pardon

There’s no one here, the gardener is gone



Ain’t talkin’, just walkin’

Up the road around the bend

Heart burnin’, still yearnin’

In the last outback, at the world’s end"

There's a ruckus in the alley and the sun will be here soon

Today's the day, gonna grab my trombone and blow

Well, there's hot stuff here and it's everywhere I go

I was thinkin' 'bout Alicia Keys, couldn't keep from crying

When she was born in Hell's Kitchen, I was living down the line

I'm wondering where in the world Alicia Keys could be

I been looking for her even clear through Tennessee

Feel like my soul is beginning to expand

Look into my heart and you will sort of understand

You brought me here, now you're trying to run me away

The writing's on the wall, come read it, come see what it say



Thunder on the mountain, rolling like a drum

Gonna sleep over there, that's where the music coming from

I don't need any guide, I already know the way

Remember this, I'm your servant both night and day

The pistols are poppin' and the power is down

I'd like to try somethin' but I'm so far from town

The sun keeps shinin' and the North Wind keeps picking up speed

Gonna forget about myself for a while, gonna go out and see what others need

I've been sitting down studying the art of love

I think it will fit me like a glove

I want some real good woman to do just what I say

Everybody got to wonder what's the matter with this cruel world today



Thunder on the mountain rolling to the ground

Gonna get up in the morning walk the hard road down

Some sweet day I'll stand beside my king

I wouldn't betray your love or any other thing

Gonna raise me an army, some tough sons of bitches

I'll recruit my army from the orphanages

I been to St. Herman's church and I've said my religious vows

I've sucked the milk out of a thousand cows

I got the porkchops, she got the pie

She ain't no angel and neither am I

Shame on your greed, shame on your wicked schemes

I'll say this, I don't give a damn about your dreams



Thunder on the mountain heavy as can be

Mean old twister bearing down on me

All the ladies of Washington scrambling to get out of town

Looks like something bad gonna happen, better roll your airplane down

Everybody's going and I want to go too

Don't wanna take a chance with somebody new

I did all I could and I did it right there and then

I've already confessed – no need to confess again

Gonna make a lot of money, gonna go up north

I'll plant and I'll harvest what the earth brings forth

The hammer's on the table, the pitchfork's on the shelf

For the love of God, you ought to take pity on yourself

2006,Modern Times,Spirit on the Water,"Spirit on the water

Darkness on the face of the deep

I keep thinking about you baby

I can’t hardly sleep

I’m traveling by land

Traveling through the dawn of day

You’re always on my mind

I can’t stay away

I’d forgotten about you

Then you turned up again

I always knew

That we were meant to be more than friends

When you are near

It’s just as plain as it can be

I’m wild about you, gal

You ought to be a fool about me



Can’t explain

The sources of this hidden pain

You burned your way into my heart

You got the key to my brain

I’ve been trampling through mud

Praying to the powers above

I’m sweating blood

You got a face that begs for love

Life without you

Doesn’t mean a thing to me

If I can’t have you

I’ll throw my love into the deep blue sea

Sometimes I wonder

Why you can’t treat me right

You do good all day

Then you do wrong all night



When you’re with me

I’m a thousand times happier than I could ever say

What does it matter

What price I pay

They brag about your sugar

Brag about it all over town

Put some sugar in my bowl

I feel like laying down

I’m pale as a ghost

Holding a blossom on a stem

You ever seen a ghost? No

But you have heard of them

I hear your name

Ringing up and down the line

I’m saying it plain

These ties are strong enough to bind



I been in a brawl

Now I’m feeling the wall

I’m going away baby

I won’t be back ’til fall

High on the hill

You can carry all my thoughts with you

You’ve numbed my will

This love could tear me in two

I wanna be with you in paradise

And it seems so unfair

I can’t go back to paradise no more

I killed a man back there

You think I’m over the hill

You think I’m past my prime

Let me see what you got

We can have a whoppin’ good time

2006,Modern Times,When the Deal Goes Down,"In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light

Where wisdom grows up in strife

My bewildering brain, toils in vain

Through the darkness on the pathways of life

Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air

Tomorrow keeps turning around

We live and we die, we know not why

But I'll be with you when the deal goes down



We eat and we drink, we feel and we think

Far down the street we stray

I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by

Things I never meant nor wished to say

The midnight rain follows the train

We all wear the same thorny crown

Soul to soul, our shadows roll

And I'll be with you when the deal goes down



The moon gives light and shines by night

I scarcely feel the glow

We learn to live and then we forgive

O'er the road we're bound to go

More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours

That keep us so tightly bound

You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies

And I'll be with you when the deal goes down



I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes

I followed the winding stream

I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys

I know they're not what they seem

In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain

You'll never see me frown

I owe my heart to you, and that's sayin' it true

And I'll be with you when the deal goes down

2006,Modern Times,Workingman’s Blues #2,"There’s an evening’s haze settling over the town

Starlight by the edge of the creek

The buying power of the proletariat’s gone down

Money’s getting shallow and weak

The place I love best is a sweet memory

It’s a new path that we trod

They say low wages are a reality

If we want to compete abroad



My cruel weapons been laid back on the shelf

Come and sit down on my knee

You are dearer to me than myself

As you yourself can see

I’m listening to the steel rails hum

Got both eyes tight shut

I’m just trying to keep the hunger from

Creepin’ its way into my gut



Meet me at the bottom, don’t lag behind

Bring me my boots and shoes

You can hang back or fight your best on the front line

Sing a little bit of these workingman’s blues



I’m sailing on back getting ready for the long haul

Leaving everything behind

If I stay here I’ll lose it all

The bandits will rob me blind

I’m trying to feed my soul with thought

Gonna sleep off the rest of the day

Sometimes nobody wants what you got

Sometimes you can’t give it away



I woke up this morning and sprang to my feet

Went into town on a whim

I saw my father there in the street

At least I think it was him

In the dark I hear the night birds call

The hills are rugged and steep

I sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall

If I told you my whole story you’d weep



Meet me at the bottom, don’t lag behind

Bring me my boots and shoes

You can hang back or fight your best on the front line

Sing a little bit of these workingman’s blues



They burned my barn and they stole my horse

I can’t save a dime

It’s a long way down and I don’t want to be forced

Into a life of continual crime

I can see for myself that the sun is sinking

O’er the banks of the deep blue sea

Tell me, am I wrong in thinking

That you have forgotten me



Now they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret

They waste your nights and days

Them, I will forget

You, I’ll remember always

It’s a cold black night and it’s midsummer’s eve

And the stars are spinning around

I still find it so hard to believe

That someone would kick me when I’m down



Meet me at the bottom, don’t lag behind

Bring me my boots and shoes

You can hang back or fight your best on the front line

Sing a little bit of these workingman’s blues



I’ll be back home in a month or two

When the frost is on the vine

I’ll punch my spear right straight through

Half-ways down your spine

I’ll lift up my arms to the starry skies

And pray the fugitive’s prayer

I’m guessing tomorrow the sun will rise

I hope the final judgment’s fair



The battle is over up in the hills

And the mist is closing in

Look at me, with all of my spoils

What did I ever win?

Gotta brand new suit and a brand new wife

I can live on rice and beans

Some people never worked a day in their life

They don’t know what work even means



Meet me at the bottom, don’t lag behind

Bring me my boots and shoes

You can hang back or fight your best on the front line Sing a little bit of these workingman’s blues"
2006,Modern Times,Beyond the Horizon,"Beyond the horizon, behind the sun

At the end of the rainbow life has only begun

In the long hours of twilight ’neath the stardust above

Beyond the horizon it is easy to love

I’m staring out the window

Of an ancient town

Petals from flowers

Falling to the ground

Beyond the horizon, in the springtime or fall

Love waits forever, for one and for all



Beyond the horizon, across the divide

’Round about midnight, we’ll be on the same side

Down in the valley the water runs cold

Beyond the horizon someone’s prayin’ for your soul

I lost my true lover

In the dusk, in the dawn

I have to recover

Get up and go on

Beyond the horizon, beyond love’s burning game

Every step that you take, I’m walking the same



Beyond the horizon, the night winds blow

The theme of a melody from many moons ago

The bells of St. Mary, how sweetly they chime

Beyond the horizon I found you just in time

Slipping and sliding

Too late to stop

Riding and gliding

It’s lonely at the top

Beyond the horizon, the sky is so blue

I’ve got more than a lifetime to live lovin’ you

All I ever do is struggle and strive

If I don't do anybody any harm, I might make it back home alive



I'm the oldest son of a crazy man

I'm in a cowboy band

Got a pile of sins to pay for and I ain't got time to hide

I'd walk through a blazing fire, baby, if I knew you was on the other side



Oh, I miss you Nettie Moore

And my happiness is o'er

Winter's gone, the river's on the rise

I loved you then and ever shall

But there's no one here that's left to tell

The world has gone black before my eyes



The world of research has gone berserk

Too much paperwork

Albert's in the graveyard, Frankie's raising hell

I'm beginning to believe what the scriptures tell



I'm going where the Southern crosses the Yellow Dog

Get away from all these demagogues

And these bad luck women stick like glue

It's either one or the other or neither of the two



She says, ""Look out daddy, don't want you to tear your pants.

You can get wrecked in this dance.""

She been cooking all day and it's gonna take me all night

I can't eat all that stuff in a single bite



The Judge is coming in, everybody rise

Lift up your eyes

You can do what you please, you don't need my advice

Before you call me any dirty names you better think twice



Getting light outside, the temperature dropped

I think the rain has stopped

I'm going to make you come to grips with fate

When I'm through with you, you'll learn to keep your business straight



Oh, I miss you Nettie Moore

And my happiness is o'er

Winter's gone, the river's on the rise

I loved you then and ever shall

But there's no one here that's left to tell

The world has gone black before my eyes



The bright spark of the steady lights

Has dimmed my sights

When you're around all my grief gives 'way

A lifetime with you is like some heavenly day



Everything I've ever known to be right has proven wrong

I'll be drifting along

The woman I'm lovin', she rules my heart

No knife could ever cut our love apart



Today I'll stand in faith and raise

The voice of praise

The sun is strong, I'm standing in the light

I wish to God that it were night



Oh, I miss you Nettie Moore

And my happiness is o'er

Winter's gone, the river's on the rise

I loved you then and ever shall

Too late to stop now even though all my friends are gone

Everything I touch seems to disappear

Everywhere I turn you are always here

I'll run this race until my earthly death

I'll defend this place with my dying breath

I turned and looked again but it was gone

All I have and all I know

I just came here to hear the drummer’s cymbal ring

There ain’t no way you can put me down

I just want to say that Hell’s my wife’s home town



Well there’s reasons for that and reasons for this

I can’t think of any just now, but I know they exist

I’m sitting in the sun ‘til my skin turns brown

I just want to say that Hell’s my wife’s home town

Home town, home town



She can make you steal, make you rob

Give you the hives, make you lose your job

Make things bad, she can make things worse

She got stuff more potent than a gypsy curse



One of these days, I’ll end up on the run

I’m pretty sure she’ll make me kill someone

I’m going inside, roll the shutters down

I just want to say that Hell’s my wife’s home town



Well there’s plenty to remember, plenty to forget

I still can remember the day we met

I lost my reason long ago

My love for her is all I know



State gone broke, the county’s dry

Don’t be looking at me with that evil eye

Keep on walking, don’t be hanging around

I’m telling you again that Hell’s my wife’s home town

Home town, home town

"
2009,Together Through Life,Forgetful Heart,"Forgetful heart

Lost your power of recall

Every little detail

You don't remember at all

The times we knew

Who would remember better then you



Forgetful heart

We laughed and had a good time you and I

It's been so long

Now you're content to let the days go by

When you were there

You were the answer to my prayer



Forgetful heart

We loved with all the love that life can give

What can I say

Without you it's so hard to live

Can't take much more

Why can't we love like we did before



Forgetful heart

Like a walking shadow in my brain

All night long

I lay awake and listen to the sound of pain

The door has closed forevermore

If indeed there ever was a door
"
2009,Together Through Life,Beyond Here Lies Nothin’,"I love you pretty baby

You're the only love I've ever known

Just as long as you stay with me

The whole world is my throne

Beyond here lies nothin'

Nothin' we can call our own



I'm movin' after midnight

Down boulevards of broken cars

Don't know what I'd do without it

Without this love that we call ours

Beyond here lies nothin'

Nothin' but the moon and stars



Down every street there's a window

And every window made of glass

We'll keep on lovin' pretty baby

For as long as love will last

Beyond here lies nothin'

But the mountains of the past



My ship is in the harbor

And the sails are spread

Listen to me pretty baby

Lay your hand upon my head

Beyond here lies nothin'

Nothin' done and nothin' said"
2009,Together Through Life,I Feel a Change Comin’ On,"Well I’m looking the world over

Looking far off into the East

And I see my baby coming

She’s walking with the village priest

I feel a change coming on

And the last part of the day is already gone



We got so much in common

We strive for the same old ends

And I just can’t wait

Wait for us to become friends

I feel a change coming on

And the fourth part of the day is already gone



Life is for love

And they say that love is blind

If you want to live easy

Baby pack your clothes with mine

I feel a change coming on

And the fourth part of the day is already gone



Ain’t no use in dreamin’

I got better things to do

Dreams never worked anyway

Even when they did come true



You’re as whorish as ever

It ain’t no surprise

We see the meaning of life

In each other’s eyes

I feel a change coming on

And the fourth part of the day is already gone



I’m hearing Billy Joe Shaver

And I’m reading James Joyce

Some people they tell me

I got the blood of the land in my voice



Everybody got all the money

Everybody got all the beautiful clothes

Everybody got all the flowers

I don’t have one single rose

I feel a change coming on

And the fourth part of the day is already gone"
2009,Together Through Life,It’s All Good,"Talk about me babe, if you must

Throw on the dirt, pile on the dust

I’d do the same thing if I could

You’ve heard what they say—they say it’s all good

All good

It’s all good



Big politician telling lies

Restaurant kitchen, all full of flies

Don’t make a bit of difference, don’t see why it should

I’ll tell ya somethin’—it’s all good

It’s all good

It’s all good



Wives are leavin’ their husbands, they beginning to roam

They leave the party and they never get home

I wouldn’t change it, even if I could

Same ol’ story—it’s all good

It’s all good

All good



Brick by brick, they tear you down

A teacup of water is enough to drown

Check your oil, look under the hood

Whatever you see, it’s all good

All good

Say it’s all good



People in the country, people on the land

Some so sick, they can hardly stand

Everybody would move away, if they could

It’s hard to believe but it’s all good

Yeah



The widow’s cry, the orphan’s plea

Everywhere you look, more misery

Come ’long with me, babe, I wish you would

You know what I’m sayin’, it’s all good

All good, I said it’s all good

All good



Cold blooded killer, stalking the town

Cop cars blinking, something bad going down

Buildings are crumbling in the neighborhood

No doubt about it, it’s all good

It’s all good

They say it’s all good



I’ll pluck off your beard and blow it in your face

This time tomorrow I’ll be rolling in your place

I’m going out back, get some firewood

It is what it is, and it’s all good

It’s all good
"
2012,Tempest,Early Roman Kings,"All the early Roman Kings in their sharkskin suits

Bowties and buttons, high top boots

Driving the spikes in, blazing the rails

Nailed in their coffins in top hats and tails

Fly away little bird, fly away, flap your wings

Fly by night like the early Roman Kings



All the early Roman Kings in the early, early morn’

Coming down the mountain, distributing the corn

Speeding through the forest, racing down the track

You try to get away, they drag you back

Tomorrow is Friday, we’ll see what it brings

Everybody’s talking ‘bout the early Roman Kings



They’re peddlers and they’re meddlers, they buy and they sell

They destroyed your city, they’ll destroy you as well

They’re lecherous and treacherous, hell bent for leather

Each of them bigger than all men put together

Sluggers and muggers wearing fancy gold rings

All the women going crazy for the early Roman Kings



I'll dress up your wounds with a blood clotted rag

I ain’t afraid to make love to a bitch or a hag

If you see me coming and you’re standing there

Wave your handkerchief in the air

I ain’t dead yet, my bell still rings

I keep my fingers crossed like the early Roman Kings



I'll strip you of life, strip you of breath

Ship you down to the house of death

One day you will ask for me

There’ll be no one else that you’ll want to see

Bring down my fiddle, tune up my strings

Gonna break it wide open like the early Roman Kings



I was up on black mountain the day Detroit fell

They killed them all off and they sent them to hell

Ding Dong Daddy, you’re coming up short

Gonna put you on trial in a Sicilian court

I’ve had my fun, I’ve had my flings

Gonna shake ‘em all down like the early Roman Kings

"
2012,Tempest,Soon After Midnight,"I’m searching for phrases to sing your praises

I need to tell someone

It’s soon after midnight and my day has just begun



A gal named Honey took my money

She was passing by

It’s soon after midnight and the moon is in my eye



My heart is cheerful, it’s never fearful

I been down on the killing floors

I’m in no great hurry, I’m not afraid of your fury

I've faced stronger walls than yours



Charlotte’s a harlot, dresses in scarlet

Mary dresses in green

It’s soon after midnight and I’ve got a date with a fairy queen



They chirp and they chatter, what does it matter

They’re lying there dying in their blood

Two Timing Slim, who’s ever heard of him?

I’ll drag his corpse through the mud



It’s now or never, more than ever

When I met you I didn’t think you would do

It’s soon after midnight and I don’t want nobody but you"
2012,Tempest,Pay in Blood,"Well I`m grinding my life away, steady and sure

Nothing more wretched than what I must endure

I`m drenched in the light that shines from the sun

I could stone you to death for the wrongs that you done



Sooner or later you`ll make a mistake

I`ll put you in a chain that you never can break

Legs and arms and body and bone

I pay in blood, but not my own



Night after night, day after day

They strip your useless hopes away

The more I take, the more I give

The more I die, the more I live



I got something in my pocket make your eyeballs swim

I got dogs that could tear you limb to limb

I`m circling around in the southern zone

I pay in blood, but not my own



Another political pumping out his piss

Another ragged beggar blowin’ ya a kiss

Life is short and it don’t last long

They`ll hang you in the morning and sing ya a song



Someone must have slipped a drug in your wine

You gulped it down and you lost your mind

My head so hard, it must be made of stone

I pay in blood, but not my own



How I made it back home nobody knows

Or how I survived so many blows

I been through hell, what good did it do?

My conscience is clear, what about you?



I’ll give you justice, I’ll fatten your purse

Show me your moral virtues first

Hear me holler hear me moan

I pay in blood but not my own



You bit your lover in the bed,

Come here I`ll break your lousy head

Our nation must be saved and freed

You been accused of murder, how do you plead?



This is how I spend my days

I came to bury not to praise

I`ll drink my fill and sleep alone

I pay in blood, but not my own

"
2012,Tempest,Scarlet Town,"In Scarlet Town where I was born

There’s ivy leaf and silver thorn

The streets have names you can’t pronounce

Gold is down to a quarter of an ounce



The music starts and the people sway

Everybody says, are you going my way?

Uncle Tom still working for Uncle Bill

Scarlet town is under the hill



Scarlet Town in the month of May

Sweet William on his deathbed lay

Mistress Mary by the side of the bed

Kissing his face, heaping prayers on his head



So brave, so true, so gentle is he

I’ll weep for him as he’d weep for me

Little Boy Blue come blow your horn

In Scarlet Town where I was born



Scarlet Town in the hot noon hours

There’s palm leaf shadows and scattered flowers

Beggars crouching at the gate

Help comes but it comes too late



On marble slabs and in fields of stone

You make your humble wishes known

I touched the garment but the hem was torn

In Scarlet Town where I was born



In Scarlet Town the end is near

The seven wonders of the world are here

The evil and the good living side by side

All human forms seem glorified



Put your heart on a platter and see who’ll bite

See who’ll hold you and kiss you good night

There’s walnut groves and maple wood

In Scarlet town crying won’t do you no good



In Scarlet Town you fight your father’s foes

Up on the hill a chilly wind blows

You fight ‘em on high and you fight ‘em down in

You fight ‘em with whisky, morphine and gin



You got legs that can drive men mad

A lot of things we didn’t do that I wish we had

In Scarlet Town the sky is clear

You'll wish to God that you stayed right here



Set ‘em up Joe, play Walking The Floor

Play it for my flat chested junky whore

I’m staying up late and I’m making amends

While the smile of heaven descends



If love is a sin than beauty is a crime

All things are beautiful in their time

The black and the white, the yellow and the brown

It’s all right there for ya in Scarlet Town
"
2012,Tempest,Narrow Way,"I’m gonna walk across the desert ‘til I’m in my right mind

I won’t even think about what I left behind

Nothin' back there anyway I can call my own

Go back home, leave me alone



It’s a long road, it’s a long and narrow way

If I can’t work up to you

You’ll have to work down to me someday



Ever since the British burned the white house down

There’s a bleeding wound in the heart of town

I saw you drinking from an empty cup

I saw you buried and I saw you dug up



It’s a long road, it’s a long and narrow way

If I can’t work up to you

You’ll have to work down to me someday



Look down angel, from the skies

Help my weary soul to rise

I kissed your cheek, I dragged your plow

You broke my heart. I was your friend ‘til now



It’s a long road, it’s a long and narrow way

If I can’t work up to you

You’ll have to work down to me someday



In the courtyard of the golden sun

You stand and fight or you break and run

You went and lost your lovely head

For a drink of wine and a crust of bread



It’s a long road, it’s a long and narrow way

If I can’t work up to you

You’ll have to work down to me someday



We looted and we plundered on distant shores

Why is my share not equal to yours?

Your father left you, your mother too

Even death has washed his hands of you



It’s a long road, it’s a long and narrow way

If I can’t work up to you

You’ll have to work down to me someday



This is hard country to stay alive in

Blades are everywhere and they’re breaking my skin

I’m armed to the hilt and I’m struggling hard

You won’t get out of here unscarred



It’s a long road, it’s a long and narrow way

If I can’t work up to you

You’ll have to work down to me someday



You got too many lovers waiting at the wall

If I had a thousand tongues I couldn’t count them all

Yesterday I could have thrown them all in the sea

Today, even one may be too much for me



It’s a long road, it’s a long and narrow way

If I can’t work up to you

You’ll have to work down to me someday



Cake walking baby, you can do no wrong

Put your arms around me where they belong

I want to take you on a roller coaster ride

Lay my hands all over you, tie you to my side



It’s a long road, it’s a long and narrow way

If I can’t work up to you

You’ll have to work down to me someday



I got a heavy stacked woman with a smile on her face

And she has crowned my soul with grace

I’m still hurting from an arrow that pierced my chest

I’m gonna have to take my head and bury it between your breasts



It’s a long road, it’s a long and narrow way

If I can’t work up to you

You’ll have to work down to me someday



Been dark all night, but now it’s dawn

The moving finger is moving on

You can guard me while I sleep

Kiss away the tears I weep



It’s a long road, it’s a long and narrow way

If I can’t work up to you

You’ll have to work down to me someday



I love women and she loves men

We’ve been to the West and we going back again

I heard a voice at the dusk of day

Saying, “Be gentle brother, be gentle and pray”



It’s a long road, it’s a long and narrow way

If I can’t work up to you

You’ll have to work down to me someday
"
2012,Tempest,Tin Angel,"It was late last night when the boss came home

To a deserted mansion and a desolate throne

Servant said, “Boss, the lady’s gone

She left this morning just ‘fore dawn.”



“You got something to tell me, tell it to me, man.

Come to the point as straight as you can.”

“Old Henry Lee, chief of the clan,

Came riding through the woods and took her by the hand.”



The boss he laid back flat on his bed

He cursed the heat and he clutched his head

He pondered the future of his fate

To wait another day would be far too late



""Go fetch me my coat and my tie

And the cheapest labor that money can buy

Saddle me up my buckskin mare

If you see me go by, put up a prayer.""



Well, they rode all night and they rode all day

Eastward long on the broad highway

His spirit was tired and his vision was bent

His men deserted him and onward he went



He came to a place where the light was dull

His forehead pounding in his skull

Heavy heart was wracked with pain

Insomnia raging in his brain



Well he threw down his helmet and his cross-handled sword

He renounced his faith, he denied his Lord

Crawled on his belly, put his ear to the wall

One way or another he'd put an end to it all



He leaned down, cut the electric wire

Stared into the flames and he snorted the fire

Peered through the darkness, caught a glimpse of the two

It was hard to tell for certain who was who



He lowered himself down on a golden chain

His nerves were quaking in every vein

His knuckles were bloody, he sucked in the air

He ran his fingers through his greasy hair



They looked at each other and their glasses clinked

One single unit inseparably linked

“Got a strange premonition there’s a man close by.”

“Don’t worry about him, he wouldn’t harm a fly.”



From behind the curtain the boss crossed the floor

He moved his feet and he bolted the door

Shadows hiding the lines in his face

With all the nobility of an ancient race



She turned, she was startled with a look of surprise

With a hatred that could hit the skies

“You’re a reckless fool, I can see it in your eyes.

To come this way was by no means wise.”



“Get up, stand up, you greedy lipped wench

And cover your face or suffer the consequence.

You are making my heart full sick.

Put your clothes back on double quick.”



“Silly boy, you think me a saint.

I’ll listen no more to your words of complaint.

You’ve given me nothing but the sweetest lies.

Now hold your tongue and feed your eyes.”



“I’d have given you the stars and the planets too

But what good would these things do you?

Bow the heart, if not the knee

Or never again this world you’ll see.”



“Oh, please let not your heart be cold.

This man is dearer to me than gold.”

“Oh my dear, you must be blind.

He’s a gutless ape with a worthless mind.”



“You had your way too long with me.

Now it’s me who’ll determine how things shall be.

Try to escape,” he cussed and cursed

“You’ll have to try to get past me first.”



“I dare not let your passion rule.

You think my heart, the heart of a fool.

And you sir, you cannot deny

You made a monkey of me, what and for why?”



“I’ll have no more of this insulting chat.

The devil can have you, I’ll see to that.

Look sharp or step aside,

Or in the cradle you’ll wish you died.”



The gun went boom and the shot rang clear

First bullet grazed his ear

Second ball went right straight in

And he bent in the middle like a twisted pin



He crawled to the corner and he lowered his head

He gripped the chair and he grabbed the bed

It would take more than needle and thread

Bleeding from the mouth, he’s as good as dead



“You shot my husband down, you fiend.”

“Husband, what husband, what the hell do you mean?

He was a man of strife, a man of sin.

I cut him down and I’ll throw him to the wind.”



“Hear this,” she said, with angry breath

“You too shall meet the lord of death.

It was I who brought your soul to life.”

And she raised her robe and she drew out a knife



His face was hard and caked with sweat

His arms ached and his hands were wet

“You’re a murderous queen and a bloody wife.

If you don’t mind, I’ll have the knife.”



“We’re two of a kind and our blood runs hot.

But we’re no way similar in body and thought.

All husbands are good men, as all wives know.”

Then she pierced him to the heart and his blood did flow



His knees went limp and he reached for the door

His doom was sealed, he slid to the floor

He whispered in her ear, “This is all your fault.

My fighting days have come to a halt.”



She touched his lip and kissed his cheek

He tried to speak, but his breath was weak

“You died for me, now I'll die for you.”

She put the blade to her heart and she ran it through



All three lovers together in a heap

Thrown into the grave forever to sleep

Funeral torches blazed away

Through the towns and the villages all night and all day"
2012,Tempest,Tempest,"The pale moon rose in its glory

Out on the western town

She told a sad, sad story

Of the great ship that went down



‘Twas the fourteen day of April

Over the waves she rode

Sailing into tomorrow

To a golden age foretold



The night was bright with starlight

The seas were sharp and clear

Moving through the shadows

The promised hour was near



Lights were holding steady

Gliding over the foam

All the lords and ladies

Heading for their eternal home



The chandeliers were swaying

From the balustrades above

The orchestra was playing

Songs of faded love



The watchman he lay dreaming

As the ballroom dancers twirled

He dreamed the Titanic was sinking

Into the underworld



Leo took his sketchbook

He was often so inclined

He closed his eyes and painted

The scenery in his mind



Cupid struck his bosom

And broke it with a snap

The closest woman to him

He fell into her lap



He heard a loud commotion

Something sounded wrong

His inner spirit was saying

That he couldn’t stand here long



He staggered to the quarterdeck

No time now to sleep

Water on the quarterdeck

Already three foot deep



Smokestack leaning sideways

Heavy feet began to pound

He walked into the whirlwind

Sky spinning all around



The ship was going under

The universe opened wide

The roll was called up yonder

The angels turned aside



Lights down in the hallway

Flickering dim and dull

Dead bodies already floating

In the double bottomed hull



The engines then exploded

Propellers they failed to start

The boilers overloaded

The ship's bow split apart



Passengers were flying

Backward, forward, far and fast

They mumbled, fumbled, tumbled

Each one more weary than the last



The veil was torn asunder

‘Tween the hours of twelve and one

No change, no sudden wonder

Could undo what had been done



The watchman lay there dreaming

At fourty-five degrees

He dreamed the Titanic was sinking

Dropping to her knees



Wellington, he was sleeping

His bed began to slide

His valiant heart was beating

He pushed the tables aside



Glass of shattered crystal

Lay scattered ‘round about

He strapped on both his pistols

How long could he hold out?



His men and his companions

Were nowhere to be seen

In silence there he waited for

Time and space to intervene



The passageway was narrow

There was blackness in the air

He saw every kind of sorrow

Heard voices everywhere



Alarm bells were ringing

To hold back the swelling tide

Friends and lovers clinging

To each other side by side



Mothers and their daughters

Descending down the stairs

Jumped into the icy waters

Love and pity sent their prayers



The rich man, Mr. Astor

Kissed his darling wife

He had no way of knowing

Be the last trip of his life



Calvin, Blake and Wilson

Gambled in the dark

Not one of them would ever live to

Tell the tale of disembark



Brother rose up against brother

In every circumstance

They fought and slaughtered each other

In a deadly dance



They lowered down the lifeboats

From the sinking wreck

There were traitors, there were turncoats

Broken backs and broken necks



The bishop left his cabin

To help all those in need

Turned his eyes up to the heavens

Said, “The poor are yours to feed.”



Davey the brothel keeper

Came out, dismissed his girls

Saw the water getting deeper

Saw the changing of his world



Jim Dandy smiled

He'd never learned to swim

Saw the little crippled child

And he gave his seat to him



He saw the starlight shining

Streaming from the East

Death was on the rampage

But his heart was now at peace



They battened down the hatches

But the hatches wouldn’t hold

They drowned upon the staircase

Of brass and polished gold



Leo said to Cleo

“I think I’m going mad.”

But he'd lost his mind already

Whatever mind he had



He tried to block the doorway

To save all those from harm

Blood from an open wound

Pouring down his arm



Petals fell from flowers

‘Til all of them were gone

In the long and dreadful hours

The wizard’s curse played on



The host was pouring brandy

He was going down slow

He stayed right ‘til the end

He was the last to go



There were many, many others

Nameless here forevermore

They'd never sailed the ocean

Or left their homes before



The watchman, he lay dreaming

The damage had been done

He dreamed the Titanic was sinking

And he tried to tell someone



The captain, barely breathing

Kneeling at the wheel

Above him and beneath him

Fifty thousand tons of steel



He looked over at his compass

And he gazed into its face

Needle pointing downward

He knew he lost the race



In the dark illumination

He remembered bygone years

He read the Book of Revelation

And he filled his cup with tears



When the Reaper’s task had ended

Sixteen hundred had gone to rest

The good, the bad, the rich, the poor

The loveliest and the best



They waited at the landing

And they tried to understand

But there is no understanding

On the judgment of God’s hand



News came over the wires

And struck with deadly force

Love had lost its fires

All things had run their course



The watchman he lay dreaming

Of all things that can be

He dreamed the Titanic was sinking

Into the deep blue sea

That old oak tree, the one we used to climb



Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowin’

Blowin’ like she’s blowin’ right on time
"
2012,Tempest,Long and Wasted Years,"It’s been such a long, long time

Since we loved each other and our hearts were true

One time, for one brief day

I was the man for you



Last night I heard you talking in your sleep

Saying things you shouldn’t say

Oh, baby

You just might have to go to jail some day



Is there a place we can go?

Is there anybody we can see?

Maybe what's right for you

Isn't really right for me



I ain’t seen my family in twenty years

That ain’t easy to understand

They may be dead by now

I lost track of them after they lost their land



Shake it up baby, twist and shout

You tell me what it's all about

What you doing out in the sun anyway?

Don’t you know the sun can burn your brains right out?



My enemy slammed into the earth

I don’t know what he was worth

But he lost it all, everything and more

What a blithering fool he took me for



I wear dark glasses to cover my eyes

There’re secrets in them I can’t disguise

Come back, baby

If I hurt your feelings, I apologize



Two trains running side by side

Forty miles wide down the Eastern line

You don’t have to go, I just came to you

Because you’re a friend of mine



I think when my back was turned

The whole world behind me burned

Maybe today, if not today, maybe tomorrow

Maybe there’ll be a limit on all my sorrow



We cried on a cold and frosty morn’

We cried because our souls were torn

So much for tears

So much for those long and wasted years.

"
2012,Tempest,Roll on John,"Doctor, doctor, tell me the time of day

Another bottle’s empty, another penny spent

He turned around and he slowly walked away

They shot him in the back and down he went



Shine your light

Move it on

You burned so bright

Roll on, John



From the Liverpool docks to the red light Hamburg streets

Down in the quarry with the Quarrymen

Playing to the big crowds, playing to the cheap seats

Another day in the life on your way to your journey’s end



Shine your light

Move it on

You burned so bright

Roll on, John



Sailing through the trade winds bound for the South

Rags on your back just like any other slave

They tied your hands and they clamped your mouth

Wasn’t no way out of that deep, dark cave



Shine your light

Move it on

You burned so bright

Roll on, John



I heard the news today, oh boy

They hauled your ship up on the shore

Now the city gone dark, there is no more joy

They tore the heart right out and cut it to the core



Shine your light

Move it on

You burned so bright

Roll on, John



Put down your bags and get ‘em packed

Leave right now, you won’t be far from wrong

The sooner you go, the quicker you’ll be back

You been cooped up on an island far too long



Shine your light

Move it on

You burned so bright

Roll on, John



Slow down, you’re moving way too fast

Come together right now over me

Your bones are weary, you’re about to breathe your last

Lord, you know how hard that it can be



Shine your light

Move it on

You burned so bright

Roll on, John



Roll on John, roll through the rain and snow

Take the right hand road and go where the buffalo roam

They’ll trap you in an ambush ‘fore you know

Too late now to sail back home



Shine your light

Move it on

You burned so bright

Roll on, John



Tyger, tyger, burning bright

I pray the Lord my soul to keep

In the forest of the night

Cover him over, and let him sleep



Shine your light

Move it on

You burned so bright

Roll on, John"
2020,Rough and Rowdy Ways,Crossing the Rubicon,"I crossed the Rubicon on the 14th day of the most dangerous month of the year

At the worst time at the worst place - that’s all I seem to hear

I got up early so I could greet the Goddess of the Dawn

I painted my wagon - I abandoned all hope and I crossed the Rubicon



The Rubicon is the Red River, going gently as she flows

Redder then your ruby lips and the blood that flows from the rose

Three miles north of purgatory - one step from the great beyond

I prayed to the cross and I kissed the girls and I crossed the Rubicon



What are these dark days I see in this world so badly bent

How can I redeem the time - the time so idly spent

How much longer can it last - how long can this go on

I embraced my love put down my head and I crossed the Rubicon



I feel the bones beneath my skin and they’re tremblin’ with rage

I’ll make your wife a widow - you’ll never see old age

Show me one good man in sight that the sun shines down upon

I pawned my watch and I paid my debts and I crossed the Rubicon



Put my heart upon the hill where some happiness I’ll find

If I survive then let me love - let the hour be mine

Take the high road - take the low, take the one you’re on

I poured the cup and I passed it along and I crossed the Rubicon



You defiled the most lovely flower in all of womanhood

Others can be tolerant - others can be good

I’ll cut you up with a crooked knife and I’ll miss you when you’re gone

I stood between heaven and earth and I crossed the Rubicon



You won’t find any happiness here - no happiness or joy

Go back to the gutter and try your luck - find you some nice young pretty boy

Tell me how many men I need and who I can count upon

I strapped my belt and buttoned my coat and I crossed the Rubicon



I feel the Holy Spirit inside and see the light that freedom gives

I believe it’s within the reach of every man who lives

Keep as far away as possible - it’s darkest ‘fore the dawn

I turned the key and I broke it off and I crossed the Rubicon



Mona Baby, are you still in my mind - I truly believe that you are

Couldn’t be anybody else but you who’s come with me this far

The killing frost is on the ground and the autumn leaves are gone

I lit the torch and I looked to the east and I crossed the Rubicon
"
2020,Rough and Rowdy Ways,Murder Most Foul,"‘Twas a dark day in Dallas - November ‘63

The day that will live on in infamy

President Kennedy was riding high

A good day to be living and a good day to die

Being led to the slaughter like a sacrificial lamb

Say wait a minute boys, do you know who I am?

Of course we do, we know who you are

Then they blew off his head when he was still in the car

Shot down like a dog in broad daylight

‘Twas a matter of timing and the timing was right

You got unpaid debts and we’ve come to collect

We’re gon’ kill you with hatred and without any respect

We’ll mock you and shock you, we’ll grin in your face

We’ve already got someone here to take your place

The day that they blew out the brains of the king

Thousands were watching, no one saw a thing

It happened so quickly - so quick by surprise

Right there in front of everyone’s eyes



Greatest magic trick ever under the sun

Perfectly executed, skillfully done

Wolfman, oh wolfman, oh wolfman, howl

Rub a dub dub – it’s murder most foul



Hush lil children, you’ll soon understand

The Beatles are coming they’re gonna hold your hand

Slide down the banister, go get your coat

Ferry ‘cross the Mersey and go for the throat

There’s three bums comin’ all dressed in rags

Pick up the pieces and lower the flags

I’m going to Woodstock, it’s the Aquarian Age

Then I’ll go over to Altamont and sit near the stage

Put your head out the window, let the good times roll

There’s a party going on behind the grassy knoll

Stack up the bricks and pour the cement

Don’t say Dallas don’t love you, Mr. President

Put your foot in the tank and step on the gas

Try to make it to the triple underpass

Black face singer - white face clown

Better not show your faces after the sun goes down



I’m in the red-light district like a cop on the beat

Living in a nightmare on Elm Street

When you’re down on Deep Ellum put your money in your shoe

Don’t ask what your country can do for you

Cash on the barrel head, money to burn

Dealey Plaza, make a left hand turn

Go down to the crossroads, try to flag a ride

That’s the place where Faith, Hope and Charity died

Shoot ‘em while he runs, boy, shoot ‘em while you can

See if you can shoot the Invisible Man

Goodbye, Charlie, goodbye Uncle Sam Frankly, Miss Scarlet, I don’t give a damn

What is the truth and where did it go

Ask Oswald and Ruby - they oughta know

Shut your mouth, says the wise old owl

Business is business and it’s murder most foul



Tommy can you hear me, I’m the Acid Queen

I’m ridin’ in a long black Lincoln limousine

Ridin’ in the back seat, next to my wife

Heading straight on into the afterlife

I’m leaning to the left, got my head in her lap

Oh Lord, I’ve been led into some kind of a trap

We ask no quarter, no quarter do we give

We’re right down the street from the street where you live

They mutilated his body and took out his brain

What more could they do, they piled on the pain

But his soul was not there where it was supposed to be at

For the last fifty years they’ve been searching for that

Freedom, oh freedom, freedom over me

Hate to tell you, Mister, but only dead men are free

Send me some loving - tell me no lie

Throw the gun in the gutter and walk on by

Wake up, Little Suzie, let’s go for a drive

Cross the Trinity River, let’s keep hope alive

Turn the radio on, don’t touch the dials

Parkland Hospital’s only six more miles

You got me dizzy Miss Lizzy, you filled me with lead

That magic bullet of yours has gone to my head

I’m just a patsy like Patsy Cline

I never shot anyone from in front or behind

Got blood in my eyes, got blood in my ear

I’m never gonna make it to the New Frontier



Zapruder’s film, I’ve seen that before

Seen it thirty three times, maybe more

It’s vile and deceitful - it’s cruel and it’s mean

Ugliest thing that you ever have seen

They killed him once, they killed him twice

Killed him like a human sacrifice

The day that they killed him, someone said to me, “Son, The age of the anti-Christ has just only begun.”

Air Force One coming in through the gate

Johnson sworn in at two thirty-eight

Let me know when you decide to throw in the towel

It is what it is and it’s murder most foul



What’s New Pussycat - wha’d I say

I said the soul of a nation been torn away

It’s beginning to go down into a slow decay

And that it’s thirty-six hours past judgment day

Doctor said McKinley - death is on the wall

Say it to me if you got something to confess

I heard all about it - he was going down slow

Heard it on the wireless radio

From down in the boondocks - way down in Key West



I’m searchin’ for love and inspiration

On that pirate radio station

It’s comin’ out of Luxembourg and Budapest

Radio signal clear as can be

I’m so deep in love I can hardly see

Down in the flatlands - way down in Key West



Key West is the place to be

If you’re lookin’ for immortality

Stay on the road – follow the highway sign

Key West is fine and fair

If you lost your mind, you’ll find it there

Key West is on the horizon line



I was born on the wrong side of the railroad track

Like Ginsberg, Corso and Kerouac

Like Louie and Jimmy and Buddy and all of the rest

It might not be the thing to do

But I’m stickin’ with you through and through

Down in the flatlands - way down in Key West



I got both my feet planted square on the ground

Got my right hand high with the thumb down

Such is life - such is happiness

Hibiscus flowers grow everywhere here

If you wear one put it behind your ear

Down on the bottom - way down in Key West



Key West is the place to go

Down by the Gulf of Mexico

Beyond the sea - beyond the shifting sand

Key West is the gateway key

To innocence and purity

Key West - Key West is the enchanted land



I’ve never lived in the land of Oz

Or wasted my time with an unworthy cause

It’s hot down here and you can’t be overdressed

The tiny blossoms of a toxic plant

They can make you dizzy - I’d like to help ya but I can’t

Down in the flatlands - way down in Key West



The fishtail ponds and the orchid trees

They can give you the bleedin’ heart disease

People tell me - I oughta try a little tenderness

Amelia Street - Bay View Park

Walkin’ in the shadows after dark

Down under - way down in Key West



I play the gumbo limbo spirituals

I know all the Hindu rituals

People tell me that I’m truly blessed

Bougainvillea bloomin’ in the summer and spring

Winter here is an unknown thing

Down the flatlands - way down in Key West



Key West is under the sun

Under the radar - under the gun

You stay to the left and then you lean to the right

Feel the sunlight on your skin

And the healing virtues of the wind

Key West - Key West is the land of light



Wherever I travel - wherever I roam

I’m not that far from the convent home

I do what I think is right - what I think is best

Mystery Street off Mallory Square

Truman had his White House there

Eastbound - westbound

Way down in Key West



Twelve years old and they put me in a suit

Forced me to marry a prostitute

There were gold fringes on her wedding dress

That’s my story but not where it ends

She’s still cute and we’re still friends

Down in the bottom - way down in Key West



I play both sides against the middle

Pickin’ up that pirate radio signal

I heard the news - I heard your last request

Fly around my Pretty Little Miss

I don’t love nobody - gimme a kiss

Down at the bottom - way down in Key West



Key West is the place to be

If you’re lookin’ for immortality

Key West is paradise divine

Key West is fine and fair

If you lost your mind you’ll find it there

Key West is on the horizon line

2020,Rough and Rowdy Ways,False Prophet,"Another day without end - another ship going out

Another day of anger - bitterness and doubt

I know how it happened - I saw it begin

I opened my heart to the world and the world came in



Hello Mary Lou - Hello Miss Pearl

My fleet footed guides from the underworld

No stars in the sky shine brighter than you

You girls mean business and I do too



I’m the enemy of treason - the enemy of strife

I’m the enemy of the unlived meaningless life

I ain’t no false prophet - I just know what I know

I go where only the lonely can go



I’m first among equals - second to none

I’m last of the best - you can bury the rest

Bury ‘em naked with their silver and gold

Put ‘em six feet under and then pray for their souls



What are you lookin’ at - there’s nothing to see

Just a cool breeze encircling me

Let’s walk in the garden - so far and so wide

We can sit in the shade by the fountain side



I’ve searched the world over for the Holy Grail

I sing songs of love - I sing songs of betrayal

Don’t care what I drink - don’t care what I eat

I climbed a mountain of swords on my bare feet



You don’t know me darlin’ - you never would guess

I’m nothing like my ghostly appearance would suggest

I ain’t no false prophet - I just said what I said

I’m here to bring vengeance on somebody’s head



Put out your hand - there’s nothin’ to hold

Open your mouth - I’ll stuff it with gold

Oh you poor Devil - look up if you will

The City of God is there on the hill



Hello stranger - Hello and goodbye

You rule the land but so do I

You lusty old mule - you got a poisoned brain

I’m gonna marry you to a ball and chain



You know darlin’ the kind of life that I live

When your smile meets my smile - something’s got to give

I ain’t no false prophet - I’m nobody’s bride

Can’t remember when I was born and I forgot when I died
"
2020,Rough and Rowdy Ways,My Own Version of You,"All through the summers and into January

I’ve been visiting morgues and monasteries

Looking for the necessary body parts

Limbs and livers and brains and hearts



I want to bring someone to life - is what I want to do

I want to create my own version of you



It must be the winter of my discontent

I wish you’d taken me with you wherever you went

They talk all night - they talk all day

Not for a second do I believe what they say



I want to bring someone to life - someone I’ve never seen

You know what I mean - you know exactly what I mean



I’ll take Scarface Pacino and the Godfather Brando

Mix ‘em up in a tank and get a robot commando

If I do it upright and put the head on straight

I’ll be saved by the creature that I create

I get blood from a cactus - make gunpowder from ice

I don’t gamble with cards and I don’t shoot no dice

Can you look in my face with your sightless eye

Can you cross your heart and hope to die



I’ll bring someone to life - someone for real

Someone who feels the way that I feel



I study Sanskrit and Arabic to improve my mind

I want to do things for the benefit of all mankind

I say to the willow tree - don’t weep for me

I’m saying the hell with all things that used to be

I get into trouble and I hit the wall

No place to turn - no place at all

I pick a number between one and two

And I ask myself what would Julius Caesar do



I’ll bring someone to life - in more ways than one

Don’t matter how long it takes - it’ll be done when it’s done



I’m gonna make you play the piano like Leon Russell

Like Liberace - like St. John the Apostle

Play every number that I can play

I’ll see you baby on Judgement Day

After midnight if you still want to meet

I’ll be at the Black Horse Tavern on Armageddon Street

Two doors down not that far to walk

I’ll hear your footsteps - you won’t have to knock



I’ll bring someone to life - balance the scales

I’m not gonna get involved in any insignificant details



You can bring it to St. Peter - you can bring it to Jerome

You can move it on over - bring it all the way home

Bring it to the corner where the children play

You can bring it to me on a silver tray



I’ll bring someone to life - spare no expense

Do it with decency and common sense



Can you tell me what it means to be or not to be

You won’t get away with fooling me

Can you help me walk that moonlight mile

Can you give me the blessings of your smile



I want to bring someone to life - use all my powers

Do it in the dark in the wee small hours



I can see the history of the whole human race

It’s all right there - its carved into your face

Should I break it all down - should I fall on my knees

Is there light at the end of the tunnel - can you tell me please

Stand over there by the Cypress tree

Where the Trojan women and children were sold into slavery

Long ago before the First Crusade

Way back before England or America were made

Step right into the burning hell

Where some of the best known enemies of mankind dwell

Mister Freud with his dreams and Mister Marx with his axe

See the raw hide lash rip the skin off their backs

You got the right spirit - you can feel it you can hear it

You got what they call the immortal spirit

You can feel it all night you can feel it in the morn

Creeps into your body the day you are born

One strike of lightning is all that I need

And a blast of ‘lectricity that runs at top speed

Show me your ribs - I’ll stick in the knife

I’m gonna jump start my creation to life



I want to bring someone to life - turn back the years

Do it with laughter - do it with tears"
2020,Rough and Rowdy Ways,I’ve Made Up My Mind to Give Myself to You,"Sitting on my terrace lost in the stars

Listenin’ to the sounds of the sad guitars

Been thinking it over and I thought it all through

I’ve made up my mind to give myself to you



I saw the first fall of snow

I saw the flowers come and go

I don’t think anyone else ever knew

I made up my mind to give myself to you



I’m giving myself to you, I am

From Salt Lake City to Birmingham

From East L.A. to San Antone

I don’t think I could bear to live my life alone



My eye is like a shooting star

It looks at nothing, neither near or far

No one ever told me, it’s just something I knew

I’ve made up my mind to give myself to you



If I had the wings of a snow white dove

I’d preach the gospel, the gospel of love

A love so real - a love so true

I made up my mind to give myself to you



Take me out traveling, you’re a traveling man

Show me something that I’ll understand

I’m not what I was, things aren’t what they were

I’m going to go far away from home with her



I traveled the long road of despair

I met no other traveler there

A lot of people gone, a lot of people I knew

I’ve made up my mind to give myself to you



My heart’s like a river - a river that sings

It just takes me a while to realize things

I’ll see you at sunrise - I’ll see you at dawn

I’ll lay down beside you, when everyone is gone



From the plains and the prairies - from the mountains to the sea

I hope that the gods go easy with me

I knew you’d say yes - I’m saying it too

I’ve made up my mind to give myself to you"
2020,Rough and Rowdy Ways,Black Rider,"Black Rider Black Rider you been livin’ too hard

You been up all night havin’ to stay on your guard

The path that you’re walkin’ - is too narrow to walk

Every step of the way another stumblin’ block

The road that you’re on - same road that you know

But it’s not the same as - it was a minute ago



Black Rider Black Rider you’ve seen it all

You’ve seen the great world and you’ve seen the small

You fell into the fire and you’re eating the flame

Better seal up your lips if you want to stay in the game

Be reasonable Mister - be honest be fair

Let all of your earthly thoughts be a prayer



Black Rider Black Rider all dressed in black

I’m walking away and you try to make me look back

My heart is at rest I’d like to keep it that way

I don’t want to fight - at least not today

Go home to your wife stop visiting mine

One of these days I’ll forget to be kind



Black Rider Black Rider tell me when - tell me how

If there ever was a time then let it be now

Let me go through - open the door

My soul is distressed my mind is at war

Don’t hug me - don’t flatter me - don’t turn on the charm

I’ll take out a sword and have to hack off your arm



Black Rider Black Rider hold it right there

The size of your cock will get you nowhere

I’ll suffer in silence I’ll not make a sound

Maybe I’ll take the - high moral ground

Some enchanted evening I’ll sing you a song

Black Rider Black Rider you’ve been on the job too long

2020,Rough and Rowdy Ways,Goodbye Jimmy Reed,"I live on a street named after a Saint

Women in the churches wear powder and paint

Where the Jews and the Catholics and the Muslims all pray

I can tell a Proddy from a mile away

Goodbye Jimmy Reed - Jimmy Reed indeed

Give me that old time religion, it’s just what I need



For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory

Go tell it on the Mountain, go tell the real story

Tell it in that straight forward puritanical tone

In the mystic hours when a person’s alone

Goodbye Jimmy Reed - Godspeed

Thump on the bible - proclaim the creed



You won’t amount to much the people all said

‘Cause I didn’t play guitar behind my head

Never pandered never acted proud

Never took off my shoes and threw them into the crowd

Goodbye Jimmy Reed - goodbye and goodnight

I’ll put a jewel in your crown - I’ll put out the light



They threw everything at me, everything in the book

Had nothing to fight with but a butcher’s hook

They have no pity - they don’t lend a hand

And I can’t sing a song that I don’t understand

Goodbye Jimmy Reed - goodbye and good luck

Can’t play the record ‘cause my needle got stuck



Transparent woman in a transparent dress

It suits you well - I must confess

I’ll break open your grapes I’ll suck out the juice

I need you like my head needs a noose

Goodbye Jimmy Reed, goodbye and so long

I thought I could resist her but I was so wrong



G-d be with you, brother dear

If you don’t mind me asking, what brings you here?

Oh, nothing much, I’m just looking for the man

I came to see where he’s lying in this lost land

Goodbye Jimmy Reed and with everything within ya

Can’t you hear me calling from down in Virginia"

Sing of the lakes and the nymphs in the forest

Sing your hearts out - all you women of the chorus

Sing of honor and fame and of glory be

Mother of Muses, sing for me



Mother of Muses sing for my heart

Sing for a love too soon to depart

Sing of the Heroes who stood alone

Whose names are engraved on tablets of stone

Who struggled with pain so the world could go free

Mother of Muses, sing for me



Sing of Sherman - Montgomery and Scott

Sing of Zhukov and Patton and the battles they fought

Who cleared the path for Presley to sing

Who carved out the path for Martin Luther King

Who did what they did and then went on their way

Man, I could tell their stories all day



I’m falling in love with Calliope

She doesn’t belong to anybody - why not give her to me

She’s speaking to me, speaking with her eyes

I’ve grown so tired of chasing lies

Mother of Muses wherever you are

I’ve already outlived my life by far



Mother of Muses unleash your wrath

Things I can’t see - they’re blocking my path

Show me your wisdom - tell me my fate

Put me upright - make me walk straight

Forge my identity from the inside out

You know what I’m talking about



Take me to the river and release your charms

Let me lay down in your sweet lovin’ arms

Wake me - shake me - free me from sin

Make me invisible like the wind

Got a mind to ramble - got a mind to roam

I’m travelin’ light and I’m slow coming home

I fuss with my hair and I fight blood feuds . . . I contain multitudes



Gotta tell tale heart like Mr. Poe

Got skeletons in the walls of people you know

I’ll drink to the truth of things that we said

I’ll drink to the man that shares your bed

I paint landscapes - I paint nudes . . . I contain multitudes



A red Cadillac and a black moustache

Rings on my fingers that sparkle and flash

Tell me what’s next - what shall we do

Half my soul baby belongs to you

I rollick and I frolic with all the young dudes . . . I contain multitudes



I’m just like Anne Frank - like Indiana Jones

And them British bad boys the Rolling Stones

I go right to the edge - I go right to the end

I go right where all things lost - are made good again



I sing the songs of experience like William Blake

I have no apologies to make

Everything’s flowin’ all at the same time

I live on the boulevard of crime

I drive fast cars and I eat fast foods . . . I contain multitudes



Pink pedal pushers and red blue jeans

All the pretty maids and all the old queens

All the old queens from all my past lives

I carry four pistols and two large knives

I’m a man of contradictions and a man of many moods . . . I contain multitudes



Greedy old wolf - I’ll show you my heart

But not all of it - only the hateful part

I’ll sell you down the river - I’ll put a price on your head

What more can I tell ya - I sleep with life and death in the same bed



Get lost Madam - get up off my knee

Keep your mouth away from me

I’ll keep the path open - the path in my mind

I’ll see to it that there’s no love left behind

I play Beethoven sonatas Chopin’s preludes . . . I contain multitudes"
