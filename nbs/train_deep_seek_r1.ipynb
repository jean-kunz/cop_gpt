They first tried just pure **RL** to see if reasoning would pop up by itself **that was DeepSeek-R1-Zero**, kinda an experiment. Then for the **real DeepSeek-R1**, they made it more organized with different stages. They give it some starting data to get it going, then do RL, then more data, then more RL… it’s like leveling up, step by step!\n",

    "The RL agent (DeepSeek V3/Qwen2–0.5B) starts by taking an **Action**, which means it generates an answer and some reasoning for a given problem that’s put into its **Environment**. The Environment, in this case, is simply the reasoning task itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "After taking an action, the Environment gives back a **Reward**. This Reward is like feedback, it tells our base model (DeepSeek V3/Qwen2–0.5B) how good its action was. A positive Reward means it did something right, maybe got the answer correct or reasoned well. This feedback signal then goes back to our base model, helping it learn and adjust how it takes actions in the future to get even better Rewards.\n",

    "\n",
    "So that we have understand a basic RL flow now we need to learn what exact RL algorithm DeepSeek uses for R1-Zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many RL algos available, but traditional RL use something called a **“critic” **to help the main decision making part (“actor” i.e. DeepSeek-V3/Qwen2-0.5B). This critic is usually just as big and complex as the actor itself, which basically doubles the amount of computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "But DeepSeek uses GRPO for training their initial (R1 Zero), **GRPO** does things differently because it figures out a baseline, a kind of reference point for good actions directly from the results it gets from a **group** of actions. Because of this, GRPO doesn’t need a separate critic model at all. This saves a lot of computation and makes things more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s draw a flowchart of how GRPO is being used for R1 Zero training, and then we will **interpretate** it.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Let’s understand how DeepSeek GRPO implementation works with our base model (Qwen2–0.5B). \n",
    "\n",
    "First, the **Problem Input (A)** is given to the **Qwen Model (B)**, Qwen attempts to generate an answer through **Generate Completion (C)**. The final result, called the **Completion Output (D)**, includes reasoning steps in <think> tags and the final solution in <answer> tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the **Problem Input (A)** and the **Ground Truth Solution (E)** are fed into the **Reward Functions (F)**, acting as intelligent graders. These functions compare Qwen **Completion Output (D)** with the correct solution and evaluate different aspects such as:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. **Accuracy** (is the answer correct?)\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. **Format** (are the <think> and <answer> tags used properly?)\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. **Reasoning Steps** (is the logic clear?)\n",
    "\n",
    " 4. **Cosine Scaling** (is the response concise?)\n",
    "\n",
    " 5. **Repetition Penalty** (is there unnecessary repetition?).\n",
    "\n",
    "These evaluations produce **Reward Scores (G)**, which are then passed to the **GRPO Trainer (H)**. The trainer uses gradients to adjust the **Qwen Model (B)**, fine-tuning how it generates answers. This process is called **Gradient Reward Policy Optimization** because it optimizes Qwen responses using **gradients**, **reward feedback**, and **policy adjustments** to maximize performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the updated **Qwen Model (B)** is tested again on new problems, continuously refining itself through repeated cycles. With each iteration, Qwen becomes a better problem solver.\n",
