       "'Come you ladies and you gentlemen, a-listen to my song\\n\\nSing it to you right, but you might think it’s wrong\\n\\nJust a little glimpse of a story I’ll tell\\n\\n’Bout an East Coast city that you all know well\\n\\nIt’s hard times in the city\\n\\nLivin’ down in New York town\\n\\n\\n\\nOld New York City is a friendly old town\\n\\nFrom Washington Heights to Harlem on down\\n\\nThere’s a-mighty many people all millin’ all around\\n\\nThey’ll kick you when you’re up and knock you when you’re down\\n\\nIt’s hard times in the city\\n\\nLivin’ down in New York town\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate\\n\\nTo Rockefeller Plaza ’n’ the Empire State.\\n\\nMister Rockefeller sets up as high as a bird\\n\\nOld Mister Empire never says a word\\n\\nIt’s hard times from the country\\n\\nLivin’ down in New York town\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, it’s up in the mornin’ tryin’ to find a job of work\\n\\nStand in one place till your feet begin to hurt\\n\\nIf you got a lot o’ money you can make yourself merry\\n\\nIf you only got a nickel, it’s the Staten Island Ferry\\n\\nAnd it’s hard times in the city\\n\\nLivin’ down in New York town\\n\\n\\n\\nMister Hudson come a-sailin’ down the stream\\n\\nAnd old Mister Minuet paid for his dream\\n\\nBought your city on a one-way track\\n\\n’F I had my way I’d sell it right back\\n\\nAnd it’s hard times in the city\\n\\nLivin’ down in New York town\\n\\n\\n\\nI’ll take all the smog in Cal-i-for-ne-ay\\n\\n’N’ every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains\\n\\n’N’ the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines\\n\\nIt’s all much cleaner than the New York kind\\n\\nAnd it’s hard times in the city\\n\\nLivin’ down in New York town\\n\\n\\n\\nSo all you newsy people, spread the news around\\n\\nYou c’n listen to m’ story, listen to m’ song\\n\\nYou c’n step on my name, you c’n try ’n’ get me beat\\n\\nWhen I leave New York, I’ll be standin’ on my feet\\n\\nAnd it’s hard times in the city\\n\\nLivin’ down in New York town\\n\\n’ll sing you a song, ain’t very long\\n\\n’Bout an old man who never done wrong\\n\\nHow he died nobody can say\\n\\nThey found him dead in the street one day\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, the crowd, they gathered one fine morn\\n\\nAt the man whose clothes ’n’ shoes were torn\\n\\nThere on the sidewalk he did lay\\n\\nThey stopped ’n’ stared ’n’ walked their way\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, the p’liceman come and he looked around\\n\\n“Get up, old man, or I’m a-takin’ you down”\\n\\nHe jabbed him once with his billy club\\n\\nAnd the old man then rolled off the curb\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, he jabbed him again and loudly said\\n\\n“Call the wagon; this man is dead”\\n\\nThe wagon come, they loaded him in\\n\\nI never saw the man again\\n\\n\\n\\nI’ve sung you my song, it ain’t very long\\n\\n’Bout an old man who never done wrong\\n\\nHow he died no one can say\\n\\nThey found him dead in the street one day\\n\\nI saw it advertised one day\\n\\nBear Mountain picnic was comin’ my way\\n\\n“Come along ’n’ take a trip\\n\\nWe’ll bring you up there on a ship\\n\\nBring the wife and kids\\n\\nBring the whole family”\\n\\nYippee!\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I run right down ’n’ bought a ticket\\n\\nTo this Bear Mountain Picnic\\n\\nBut little did I realize\\n\\nI was in for a picnic surprise\\n\\nHad nothin’ to do with mountains\\n\\nI didn’t even come close to a bear\\n\\n\\n\\nTook the wife ’n’ kids down to the pier\\n\\nSix thousand people there\\n\\nEverybody had a ticket for the trip\\n\\n“Oh well,” I said, “it’s a pretty big ship\\n\\nBesides, anyway, the more the merrier”\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, we all got on ’n’ what d’ya think\\n\\nThat big old boat started t’ sink\\n\\nMore people kept a-pilin’ on\\n\\nThat old ship was a-slowly goin’ down\\n\\nFunny way t’ start a picnic\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I soon lost track of m’ kids ’n’ wife\\n\\nSo many people there I never saw in m’ life\\n\\nThat old ship sinkin’ down in the water\\n\\nSix thousand people tryin’ t’ kill each other\\n\\nDogs a-barkin’, cats a-meowin’\\n\\nWomen screamin’, fists a-flyin’, babies cryin’\\n\\nCops a-comin’, me a-runnin’\\n\\nMaybe we just better call off the picnic\\n\\n\\n\\nI got shoved down ’n’ pushed around\\n\\nAll I could hear there was a screamin’ sound\\n\\nDon’t remember one thing more\\n\\nJust remember wakin’ up on a little shore\\n\\nHead busted, stomach cracked\\n\\nFeet splintered, I was bald, naked . . .\\n\\nQuite lucky to be alive though\\n\\n\\n\\nFeelin’ like I climbed outa m’ casket\\n\\nI grabbed back hold of m’ picnic basket\\n\\nTook the wife ’n’ kids ’n’ started home\\n\\nWishin’ I’d never got up that morn\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, I don’t care just what you do\\n\\nIf you wanta have a picnic, that’s up t’ you\\n\\nBut don’t tell me about it, I don’t wanta hear it\\n\\n’Cause, see, I just lost all m’ picnic spirit\\n\\nStay in m’ kitchen, have m’ own picnic . . .\\n\\nIn the bathroom\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, it don’t seem to me quite so funny\\n\\nWhat some people are gonna do f’r money\\n\\nThere’s a bran’ new gimmick every day\\n\\nJust t’ take somebody’s money away\\n\\nI think we oughta take some o’ these people\\n\\nAnd put ’em on a boat, send ’em up to Bear Mountain . . .\\n\\nFor a picnic\\n\\n\\nI will not go down under the ground\\n\\n’Cause somebody tells me that death’s comin’ ’round\\n\\nAn’ I will not carry myself down to die\\n\\nWhen I go to my grave my head will be high\\n\\nLet me die in my footsteps\\n\\nBefore I go down under the ground\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s been rumors of war and wars that have been\\n\\nThe meaning of life has been lost in the wind\\n\\nAnd some people thinkin’ that the end is close by\\n\\n’Stead of learnin’ to live they are learnin’ to die\\n\\nLet me die in my footsteps\\n\\nBefore I go down under the ground\\n\\n\\n\\nI don’t know if I’m smart but I think I can see\\n\\nWhen someone is pullin’ the wool over me\\n\\nAnd if this war comes and death’s all around\\n\\nLet me die on this land ’fore I die underground\\n\\nLet me die in my footsteps\\n\\nBefore I go down under the ground\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s always been people that have to cause fear\\n\\nThey’ve been talking of the war now for many long years\\n\\nI have read all their statements and I’ve not said a word\\n\\nBut now Lawd God, let my poor voice be heard\\n\\nLet me die in my footsteps\\n\\nBefore I go down under the ground\\n\\n\\n\\nIf I had rubies and riches and crowns\\n\\nI’d buy the whole world and change things around\\n\\nI’d throw all the guns and the tanks in the sea\\n\\nFor they are mistakes of a past history\\n\\nLet me die in my footsteps\\n\\nBefore I go down under the ground\\n\\n\\n\\nLet me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood\\n\\nLet the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood\\n\\nLet me sleep in your meadows with the green grassy leaves\\n\\nLet me walk down the highway with my brother in peace\\n\\nLet me die in my footsteps\\n\\nBefore I go down under the ground\\n\\n\\n\\nGo out in your country where the land meets the sun\\n\\nSee the craters and the canyons where the waterfalls run\\n\\nNevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho\\n\\nLet every state in this union seep down deep in your souls\\n\\nAnd you’ll die in your footsteps\\n\\nBefore you go down under the ground\\n\\nCome around you rovin’ gamblers and a story I will tell\\n\\nAbout the greatest gambler, you all should know him well\\n\\nHis name was Will O’Conley and he gambled all his life\\n\\nHe had twenty-seven children, yet he never had a wife\\n\\nAnd it’s ride, Willie, ride\\n\\nRoll, Willie, roll\\n\\nWherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows\\n\\n\\n\\nHe gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards\\n\\nWherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards\\n\\nHe had the reputation as the gamblin’est man around\\n\\nWives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town\\n\\nAnd it’s ride, Willie, ride\\n\\nRoll, Willie, roll\\n\\nWherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows\\n\\n\\n\\nSailin’ down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans\\n\\nThey’re still talkin’ about their card game on that Jackson River Queen\\n\\n“I’ve come to win some money,” Gamblin’ Willie says\\n\\nWhen the game finally ended up, the whole damn boat was his\\n\\nAnd it’s ride, Willie, ride\\n\\nRoll, Willie, roll\\n\\nWherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows\\n\\n\\n\\nUp in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek\\n\\nThere was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week\\n\\nNine hundred miners had laid their money down\\n\\nWhen Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole damn town\\n\\nAnd it’s ride, Willie, ride\\n\\nRoll, Willie, roll\\n\\nWherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true\\n\\nHe supported all his children and all their mothers too\\n\\nHe wore no rings or fancy things, like other gamblers wore\\n\\nHe spread his money far and wide, to help the sick and the poor\\n\\nAnd it’s ride, Willie, ride\\n\\nRoll, Willie, roll\\n\\nWherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew\\n\\nWhether he was bluffin’ or whether he was true\\n\\nHe won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair\\n\\nThe man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn’t even have a pair\\n\\nAnd it’s ride, Willie, ride\\n\\nRoll, Willie, roll\\n\\nWherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was late one evenin’ during a poker game\\n\\nA man lost all his money, he said Willie was to blame\\n\\nHe shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate\\n\\nWhen Willie’s cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights\\n\\nAnd it’s ride, Willie, ride\\n\\nRoll, Willie, roll\\n\\nWherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows\\n\\n\\n\\nSo all you rovin’ gamblers, wherever you might be\\n\\nThe moral of the story is very plain to see\\n\\nMake your money while you can, before you have to stop\\n\\nFor when you pull that dead man’s hand, your gamblin’ days are up\\n\\nAnd it’s ride, Willie, ride\\n\\nRoll, Willie, roll\\n\\nWherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows\\n\\nHere\\'s a foreign song I learned in Utah\\n\\nHa-va-ne-gei-lah\\n\\nO-de-ley-e-e-oo-\\n\\nOh, you can read out your Bible\\n\\nYou can fall down on your knees, pretty mama\\n\\nAnd pray to

West\\n \\n Leavin’ the towns I love the best\\n \\n Thought I’d seen some ups and downs\\n \\n ’Til I come into New York town\\n \\n People goin’ down to the ground\\n \\n Buildings goin’ up to the sky\\n \\n \\n \\n Wintertime in New York town\\n \\n The wind blowin’ snow around\\n \\n Walk around with nowhere to go\\n \\n Somebody could freeze right to the bone\\n \\n I froze right to the bone\\n \\n New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years\\n \\n I didn’t feel so cold then\\n \\n \\n \\n I swung onto my old guitar\\n \\n Grabbed hold of a subway car\\n \\n And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride\\n \\n I landed up on the downtown side\\n \\n Greenwich Village\\n \\n \\n \\n I walked down there and ended up\\n \\n In one of them coffee-houses on the block\\n \\n Got on the stage to sing and play\\n \\n Man there said, “Come back some other day\\n \\n You sound like a hillbilly\\n \\n We want folk singers here”\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play\\n \\n Blowin’ my lungs out for a dollar a day\\n \\n I blowed inside out and upside down\\n \\n The man there said he loved m’ sound\\n \\n He was ravin’ about how he loved m’ sound\\n \\n Dollar a day’s worth\\n \\n \\n \\n And after weeks and weeks of hangin’ around\\n \\n I finally got a job in New York town\\n \\n In a bigger place, bigger money too\\n \\n Even joined the union and paid m’ dues\\n \\n \\n \\n Now, a very great man once said\\n \\n That some people rob you with a fountain pen\\n \\n It didn’t take too long to find out\\n \\n Just what he was talkin’ about\\n \\n A lot of people don’t have much food on their table\\n \\n But they got a lot of forks ’n’ knives\\n \\n And they gotta cut somethin’\\n \\n \\n \\n So one mornin’ when the sun was warm\\n \\n I rambled out of New York town\\n \\n Pulled my cap down over my eyes\\n \\n And headed out for the western skies\\n \\n So long, New York\\n \\n Howdy, East Orange\\n\\nI’m out here a thousand miles from my home\\n \\n Walkin’ a road other men have gone down\\n \\n I’m seein’ your world of people and things\\n \\n Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings\\n \\n \\n \\n Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song\\n \\n ’Bout a funny ol’ world that’s a-comin’ along\\n \\n Seems sick an’ it’s hungry, it’s tired an’ it’s torn\\n \\n It looks like it’s a-dyin’ an’ it’s hardly been born\\n \\n \\n \\n Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know\\n \\n All the things that I’m a-sayin’ an’ a-many times more\\n \\n I’m a-singin’ you the song, but I can’t sing enough\\n \\n ’Cause there’s not many men that done the things that you’ve done\\n \\n \\n \\n Here’s to Cisco an’ Sonny an’ Leadbelly too\\n \\n An’ to all the good people that traveled with you\\n \\n Here’s to the hearts and the hands of the men\\n \\n That come with the dust and are gone with the wind\\n \\n \\n \\n I’m a-leavin’ tomorrow, but I could leave today\\n \\n Somewhere down the road someday\\n \\n The very last thing that I’d want to do\\n \\n Is to say I’ve been hittin’ some hard travelin’ too\\n\\nWho killed Davey Moore\\n\\nWhy an’ what’s the reason for?\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not I,” says the referee\\n\\n“Don’t point your finger at me\\n\\nI could’ve stopped it in the eighth\\n\\nAn’ maybe kept him from his fate\\n\\nBut the crowd would’ve booed, I’m sure\\n\\nAt not gettin’ their money’s worth\\n\\nIt’s too bad he had to go\\n\\nBut there was a pressure on me too, you know\\n\\nIt wasn’t me that made him fall\\n\\nNo, you can’t blame me at all”\\n\\n\\n\\nWho killed Davey Moore\\n\\nWhy an’ what’s the reason for?\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not us,” says the angry crowd\\n\\nWhose screams filled the arena loud\\n\\n“It’s too bad he died that night\\n\\nBut we just like to see a fight\\n\\nWe didn’t mean for him t’ meet his death\\n\\nWe just meant to see some sweat\\n\\nThere ain’t nothing wrong in that\\n\\nIt wasn’t us that made him fall\\n\\nNo, you can’t blame us at all”\\n\\n\\n\\nWho killed Davey Moore\\n\\nWhy an’ what’s the reason for?\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not me,” says his manager\\n\\nPuffing on a big cigar\\n\\n“It’s hard to say, it’s hard to tell\\n\\nI always thought that he was well\\n\\nIt’s too bad for his wife an’ kids he’s dead\\n\\nBut if he was sick, he should’ve said\\n\\nIt wasn’t me that made him fall\\n\\nNo, you can’t blame me at all”\\n\\n\\n\\nWho killed Davey Moore\\n\\nWhy an’ what’s the reason for?\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not me,” says the gambling man\\n\\nWith his ticket stub still in his hand\\n\\n“It wasn’t me that knocked him down\\n\\nMy hands never touched him none\\n\\nI didn’t commit no ugly sin\\n\\nAnyway, I put money on him to win\\n\\nIt wasn’t me that made him fall\\n\\nNo, you can’t blame me at all”\\n\\n\\n\\nWho killed Davey Moore\\n\\nWhy an’ what’s the reason for?\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not me,” says the boxing writer\\n\\nPounding print on his old typewriter\\n\\nSayin’, “Boxing ain’t to blame\\n\\nThere’s just as much danger in a football game”\\n\\nSayin’, “Fistfighting is here to stay\\n\\nIt’s just the old American way\\n\\nIt wasn’t me that made him fall\\n\\nNo, you can’t blame me at all”\\n\\n\\n\\nWho killed Davey Moore\\n\\nWhy an’ what’s the reason for?\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not me,” says the man whose fists\\n\\nLaid him low in a cloud of mist\\n\\nWho came here from Cuba’s door\\n\\nWhere boxing ain’t allowed no more\\n\\n“I hit him, yes, it’s true\\n\\nBut that’s what I am paid to do\\n\\nDon’t say ‘murder,’ don’t say ‘kill’\\n\\nIt was destiny, it was God’s will”\\n\\n\\n\\nWho killed Davey Moore\\n\\nWhy an’ what’s the reason for?\\n\\nWell, I was feelin’ sad and feelin’ blue\\n\\nI didn’t know what in the world I wus gonna do\\n\\nThem Communists they wus comin’ around\\n\\nThey wus in the air\\n\\nThey wus on the ground\\n\\nThey wouldn’t gimme no peace . . .\\n\\n\\n\\nSo I run down most hurriedly\\n\\nAnd joined up with the John Birch Society\\n\\nI got me a secret membership card\\n\\nAnd started off a-walkin’ down the road\\n\\nYee-hoo, I’m a real John Bircher now!\\n\\nLook out you Commies!\\n\\n\\n\\nNow we all agree with Hitler’s views\\n\\nAlthough he killed six million Jews\\n\\nIt don’t matter too much that he was a Fascist\\n\\nAt least you can’t say he was a Communist!\\n\\nThat’s to say like if you got a cold you take a shot of malaria\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I wus lookin’ everywhere for them gol-darned Reds\\n\\nI got up in the mornin’ ’n’ looked under my bed\\n\\nLooked in the sink, behind the door\\n\\nLooked in the glove compartment of my car\\n\\nCouldn’t find ’em . . .\\n\\n\\n\\nI wus lookin’ high an’ low for them Reds everywhere\\n\\nI wus lookin’ in the sink an’ underneath the chair\\n\\nI looked way up my chimney hole\\n\\nI even looked deep down inside my toilet bowl\\n\\nThey got away . . .\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I wus sittin’ home alone an’ started to sweat\\n\\nFigured they wus in my T.V. set\\n\\nPeeked behind the picture frame\\n\\nGot a shock from my feet, hittin’ right up in the brain\\n\\nThem Reds caused it!\\n\\nI know they did . . . them hard-core ones\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I quit my job so I could work all alone\\n\\nThen I changed my name to Sherlock Holmes\\n\\nFollowed some clues from my detective bag\\n\\nAnd discovered they wus red stripes on the American flag!\\n\\nThat ol’ Betsy Ross . . .\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I investigated all the books in the library\\n\\nNinety percent of ’em gotta be burned away\\n\\nI investigated all the people that I knowed\\n\\nNinety-eight percent of them gotta go\\n\\nThe other two percent are fellow Birchers . . . just like me\\n\\n\\n\\nNow Eisenhower, he’s a Russian spy\\n\\nLincoln, Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy\\n\\nTo my knowledge there’s just one man\\n\\nThat’s really a true American: George Lincoln Rockwell\\n\\nI know for a fact he hates Commies cus he picketed the movie Exodus\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I fin’ly started thinkin’ straight\\n\\nWhen I run outa things to investigate\\n\\nCouldn’t imagine doin’ anything else\\n\\nSo now I’m sittin’ home investigatin’ myself!\\n\\nHope I don’t find out anything . . . hmm, great God!\\n\\n\\nTrails of troubles\\n\\nRoads of battles\\n\\nPaths of victory\\n\\nI shall walk\\n\\n\\n\\nThe trail is dusty\\n\\nAnd my road it might be rough\\n\\nBut the better roads are

battles\\n\\nPaths of victory\\n\\nWe shall walk\\n\\n\\n\\nThat evening train was rollin’\\n\\nThe hummin’ of its wheels\\n\\nMy eyes they saw a better day\\n\\nAs I looked across the

freely:\\n\\nNo younger than twelve\\n\\nNo older ’n seventeen\\n\\nThrown in like bandits\\n\\nAnd cast off like criminals\\n\\nInside the walls\\n\\nThe walls of Red Wing\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom the dirty old mess hall\\n\\nYou march to the brick wall\\n\\nToo weary to talk\\n\\nAnd too tired to sing\\n\\nOh, it’s all afternoon\\n\\nYou remember your hometown\\n\\nInside the walls\\n\\nThe walls of Red Wing\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, the gates are cast iron\\n\\nAnd the walls are barbed wire\\n\\nStay far from the fence\\n\\nWith the ’lectricity sting\\n\\nAnd it’s keep down your head\\n\\nAnd stay in your number\\n\\nInside the walls\\n\\nThe walls of Red Wing\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, it’s fare thee well\\n\\nTo the deep hollow dungeon\\n\\nFarewell to the boardwalk\\n\\nThat takes you to the screen\\n\\nAnd farewell to the minutes\\n\\nThey threaten you with it\\n\\nInside the walls\\n\\nThe walls of Red Wing\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s many a guard\\n\\nThat stands around smilin’\\n\\nHoldin’ his club\\n\\nLike he was a king\\n\\nHopin’ to get you\\n\\nBehind a wood pilin’\\n\\nInside the walls\\n\\nThe walls of Red Wing\\n\\n\\n\\nThe night aimed shadows\\n\\nThrough the crossbar windows\\n\\nAnd the wind punched hard\\n\\nTo make the wall-siding sing\\n\\nIt’s many a night\\n\\nI pretended to be a-sleepin’\\n\\nInside the walls\\n\\nThe walls of Red Wing\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the rain rattled heavy\\n\\nOn the bunkhouse shingles\\n\\nAnd the sounds in the night\\n\\nThey made my ears ring\\n\\n’Til the keys of the guards\\n\\nClicked the tune of the morning\\n\\nInside the walls\\n\\nThe walls of Red Wing\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, some of us’ll end up\\n\\nIn St. Cloud Prison\\n\\nAnd some of us’ll wind up\\n\\nTo be lawyers and things\\n\\nAnd some of us’ll stand up\\n\\nTo meet you on your crossroads\\n\\nFrom inside the walls\\n\\nThe walls of Red Wing\\n\\nWhen yer head gets twisted and yer mind grows numb\\n\\nWhen you think you\\'re too old, too young, too smart or too dumb\\n\\nWhen yer laggin\\' behind an\\' losin\\' yer pace\\n\\nIn a slow-motion crawl of life\\'s busy race\\n\\nNo matter what yer doing if you start givin\\' up\\n\\nIf the wine don\\'t come to the top of yer cup\\n\\nIf the wind\\'s got you sideways with with one hand holdin\\' on\\n\\nAnd the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone\\n\\nAnd yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it\\n\\nAnd the wood\\'s easy findin\\' but yer lazy to fetch it\\n\\nAnd yer sidewalk starts curlin\\' and the street gets too long\\n\\nAnd you start walkin\\' backwards though you know its wrong\\n\\nAnd lonesome comes up as down goes the day\\n\\nAnd tomorrow\\'s mornin\\' seems so far away\\n\\nAnd you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin\\'\\n\\nAnd yer rope is a-slidin\\' \\'cause yer hands are a-drippin\\'\\n\\nAnd yer sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys\\n\\nTurn to broken down slums and trash-can alleys\\n\\nAnd yer sky cries water and yer drain pipe\\'s a-pourin\\'\\n\\nAnd the lightnin\\'s a-flashing and the thunder\\'s a-crashin\\'\\n\\nAnd the windows are rattlin\\' and breakin\\' and the roof tops a-shakin\\'\\n\\nAnd yer whole world\\'s a-slammin\\' and bangin\\'\\n\\nAnd yer minutes of sun turn to hours of storm\\n\\nAnd to yourself you sometimes say\\n\\n\"I never knew it was gonna be this way\\n\\nWhy didn\\'t they tell me the day I was born\"\\n\\nAnd you start gettin\\' chills and yer jumping from sweat\\n\\nAnd you\\'re lookin\\' for somethin\\' you ain\\'t quite found yet\\n\\nAnd yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the air\\n\\nAnd the whole world\\'s a-watchin\\' with a window peek stare\\n\\nAnd yer good gal leaves and she\\'s long gone a-flying\\n\\nAnd yer heart feels sick like fish when they\\'re fryin\\'\\n\\nAnd yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feet\\n\\nAnd you need it badly but it lays on the street\\n\\nAnd yer bell\\'s bangin\\' loudly but you can\\'t hear its beat\\n\\nAnd you think yer ears might a been hurt\\n\\nOr yer eyes\\'ve turned filthy from the sight-blindin\\' dirt\\n\\nAnd you figured you failed in yesterdays rush\\n\\nWhen you were faked out an\\' fooled white facing a four flush\\n\\nAnd all the time you were holdin\\' three queens\\n\\nAnd it\\'s makin you mad, it\\'s makin\\' you mean\\n\\nLike in the middle of Life magazine\\n\\nBouncin\\' around a pinball machine\\n\\nAnd there\\'s something on yer mind you wanna be saying\\n\\nThat somebody someplace oughta be hearin\\'\\n\\nBut it\\'s trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer head\\n\\nAnd it bothers you badly when your layin\\' in bed\\n\\nAnd no matter how you try you just can\\'t say it\\n\\nAnd yer scared to yer soul you just might forget it\\n\\nAnd yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer head\\n\\nAnd yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead\\n\\nAnd the lion\\'s mouth opens and yer staring at his teeth\\n\\nAnd his jaws start closin with you underneath\\n\\nAnd yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behind\\n\\nAnd you wish you\\'d never taken that last detour sign\\n\\nAnd you say to yourself just what am I doin\\'\\n\\nOn this road I\\'m walkin\\', on this trail I\\'m turnin\\'\\n\\nOn this curve I\\'m hanging\\n\\nOn this pathway I\\'m strolling, in the space I\\'m taking\\n\\nIn this air I\\'m inhaling\\n\\nAm I mixed up too much, am I mixed up too hard\\n\\nWhy am I walking, where am I running\\n\\nWhat am I saying, what am I knowing\\n\\nOn this guitar I\\'m playing, on this banjo I\\'m frailin\\'\\n\\nOn this mandolin I\\'m strummin\\', in the song I\\'m singin\\'\\n\\nIn the tune I\\'m hummin\\', in the words I\\'m writin\\'\\n\\nIn the words that I\\'m thinkin\\'\\n\\nIn this ocean of hours I\\'m all the time drinkin\\'\\n\\nWho am I helping, what am I breaking\\n\\nWhat am I giving, what am I taking\\n\\nBut you try with your whole soul best\\n\\nNever to think these thoughts and never to let\\n\\nThem kind of thoughts gain ground\\n\\nOr make yer heart pound\\n\\nBut then again you know why they\\'re around\\n\\nJust waiting for a chance to slip and drop down\\n\\n\"Cause sometimes you hear\\'em when the night times comes creeping\\n\\nAnd you fear that they might catch you a-sleeping\\n\\nAnd you jump from yer bed, from yer last chapter of dreamin\\'\\n\\nAnd you can\\'t remember for the best of yer thinking\\n\\nIf that was you in the dream that was screaming\\n\\nAnd you know that it\\'s something special you\\'re needin\\'\\n\\nAnd you know that there\\'s no drug that\\'ll do for the

eyes out there\\n\\nI could see none\\n\\nAs her thoughts pounded hard\\n\\nLike the pierce of an arrow\\n\\nBut the song it was long\\n\\nAnd it had to get done\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the tune finally folded\\n\\nI laid down the guitar\\n\\nThen looked for the girl\\n\\nWho’d stayed for so long\\n\\nBut her shadow was missin’\\n\\nFor all of my searchin’\\n\\nSo I picked up my guitar\\n\\nAnd began the next song\\n\\nCorrina, Corrina\\n \\n Gal, where you been so long?\\n \\n Corrina, Corrina\\n \\n Gal, where you been so long?\\n \\n I been worr’in’ ’bout you, baby\\n \\n Baby, please come home\\n \\n \\n \\n I got a bird that whistles\\n \\n I got a bird that sings\\n \\n I got a bird that whistles\\n \\n I got a bird that sings\\n \\n But I ain’ a-got Corrina\\n \\n Life don’t mean a thing\\n \\n \\n \\n Corrina, Corrina\\n \\n Gal, you’re on my mind\\n \\n Corrina, Corrina\\n \\n Gal, you’re on my mind\\n \\n I’m a-thinkin’ ’bout you, baby\\n \\n I just can’t keep from crying.\\n\\nSome time ago a crazy dream came to me\\n \\n I dreamt I was walkin’ into World War Three\\n \\n I went to the doctor the very next day\\n \\n To see what kinda words he could say\\n \\n He said it was a bad dream\\n \\n I wouldn’t worry ’bout it none, though\\n \\n They were my own dreams and they’re only in my head\\n \\n \\n \\n I said, “Hold it, Doc, a World War passed through my brain”\\n \\n He said, “Nurse, get your pad, this boy’s insane”\\n \\n He grabbed my arm, I said, “Ouch!”\\n \\n As I landed on the psychiatric couch\\n \\n He said, “Tell me about it”\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, the whole thing started at 3 o’clock fast\\n \\n It was all over by quarter past\\n \\n I was down in the sewer with some little lover\\n \\n When I peeked out from a manhole cover\\n \\n Wondering who turned the lights on\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I got up and walked around\\n \\n And up and down the lonesome town\\n \\n I stood a-wondering which way to go\\n \\n I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road\\n \\n It was a normal day\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell\\n \\n And I leaned my head and I gave a yell\\n \\n “Give me a string bean, I’m a hungry man”\\n \\n A shotgun fired and away I ran\\n \\n I don’t blame them too much though, I know I look funny\\n \\n \\n \\n Down at the corner by a hot-dog stand\\n \\n I seen a man\\n \\n I said, “Howdy friend, I guess there’s just us two”\\n \\n He screamed a bit and away he flew\\n \\n Thought I was a Communist\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I spied a girl and before she could leave\\n \\n “Let’s go and play Adam and Eve”\\n \\n I took her by the hand and my heart it was thumpin’\\n \\n When she said, “Hey man, you crazy or sumpin’\\n \\n You see what happened last time they started”\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I seen a Cadillac window uptown\\n \\n And there was nobody aroun’\\n \\n I got into the driver’s seat\\n \\n And I drove down 42nd Street\\n \\n In my Cadillac. Good car to drive after a war\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I remember seein’ some ad\\n \\n So I turned on my Conelrad\\n \\n But I didn’t pay my Con Ed bill\\n \\n So the radio didn’t work so well\\n \\n Turned on my record player—\\n \\n It was Rock-a-day Johnny singin’, “Tell Your Ma, Tell Your Pa\\n \\n Our Love’s A-gonna Grow Ooh-wah, Ooh-wah”\\n \\n \\n \\n I was feelin’ kinda lonesome and blue\\n \\n I needed somebody to talk to\\n \\n So I called up the operator of time\\n \\n Just to hear a voice of some kind\\n \\n “When you hear the beep it will be three o’clock”\\n \\n She said that for over an hour\\n \\n And I hung up\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then\\n \\n Sayin’, “Hey I’ve been havin’ the same old dreams\\n \\n But mine was a little different you see\\n \\n I dreamt that the only person left after the war was me\\n \\n I didn’t see you around”\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, now time passed and now it seems\\n \\n Everybody’s having them dreams\\n \\n Everybody sees themselves\\n \\n Walkin’ around with no one else\\n \\n Half of the people can be part right all of the time\\n \\n Some of the people can be all right part of the time\\n \\n But all of the people can’t be all right all of the time\\n \\n I think Abraham Lincoln said that\\n \\n “I’ll let you be in my dreams if I can be in yours”\\n \\n I said that\\n\\nWell, I took me a woman late last night\\n \\n I’s three-fourths drunk, she looked uptight\\n \\n She took off her wheel, took off her bell\\n \\n Took off her wig, said, “How do I smell?\"\\n \\n I hot-footed it . . . bare-naked . . .\\n \\n Out the window!\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, sometimes I might get drunk\\n \\n Walk like a duck and stomp like a skunk\\n \\n Don’t hurt me none, don’t hurt my pride\\n \\n ’Cause I got my little lady right by my side\\n \\n (Right there\\n \\n Proud as can be)\\n \\n \\n \\n I’s out there paintin’ on the old woodshed\\n \\n When a can a black paint it fell on my head\\n \\n I went down to scrub and rub\\n \\n But I had to sit in back of the tub\\n \\n (Cost a quarter\\n \\n And I had to get out quick . . .\\n \\n Someone wanted to come in and take a sauna)\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, my telephone rang it would not stop\\n \\n It’s President Kennedy callin’ me up\\n \\n He said, “My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?”\\n \\n I said, “My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot\\n \\n Anita Ekberg\\n \\n Sophia Loren”\\n \\n (Put ’em all in the same room with Ernest Borgnine!)\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I got a woman sleeps on a cot\\n \\n She yells and hollers and squeals a lot\\n \\n Licks my face and tickles my ear\\n \\n Bends me over and buys me beer\\n \\n (She’s a honeymooner\\n \\n A June crooner\\n \\n A spoon feeder\\n \\n And a natural leader)\\n \\n \\n \\n Oh, there ain’t no use in me workin’ so heavy\\n \\n I got a woman who works on the levee\\n \\n Pumping that water up to her neck\\n \\n Every week she sends me a monthly check\\n \\n (She’s a humdinger\\n \\n Folk singer\\n \\n Dead ringer\\n \\n For a thing-a-muh jigger)\\n \\n \\n \\n Late one day in the middle of the week\\n \\n Eyes were closed I was half asleep\\n \\n I chased me a woman up the hill\\n \\n Right in the middle of an air-raid drill\\n \\n It was Little Bo Peep!\\n \\n (I jumped a fallout shelter\\n \\n I jumped a bean stalk\\n \\n I jumped a Ferris wheel)\\n \\n \\n \\n Now, the man on the stand he wants my vote\\n \\n He’s a-runnin’ for office on the ballot note\\n \\n He’s out there preachin’ in front of the steeple\\n \\n Tellin’ me he loves all kinds-a people\\n \\n (He’s eatin’ bagels\\n \\n He’s eatin’ pizza\\n \\n He’s eatin’ chitlins\\n \\n He’s eatin’ bullshit!)\\n \\n \\n \\n Oh, set me down on a television floor\\n \\n I’ll flip the channel to number four\\n \\n Out of the shower comes a grown-up man\\n \\n With a bottle of hair oil in his hand\\n \\n (It’s that greasy kid stuff\\n \\n What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is\\n \\n What do you do about Willy Mays and Yul Brynner\\n \\n Charles de Gaulle\\n \\n And Robert Louis Stevenson?)\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, the funniest woman I ever seen\\n \\n Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean\\n \\n She takes about fifteen baths a day\\n \\n Wants me to grow a cigar on my face\\n \\n (She’s a little bit heavy!)\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, ask me why I’m drunk alla time\\n \\n It levels my head and eases my mind\\n \\n I just walk along and stroll and sing\\n \\n I see better days and I do better things\\n \\n (I catch dinosaurs\\n \\n I make love to Elizabeth Taylor . . .\\n \\n Catch hell from Richard Burton!)\\n\\nWhile riding on a train goin’ west\\n \\n I fell asleep for to take my rest\\n \\n I dreamed a dream that made me sad\\n \\n Concerning myself and the first few friends I had\\n \\n \\n \\n With half-damp eyes I stared to the room\\n \\n Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon\\n \\n Where we together weathered many a storm\\n \\n Laughin’ and singin’ till the early hours of the morn\\n \\n \\n \\n By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung\\n \\n Our words were told, our songs were sung\\n \\n Where we longed for nothin’ and were quite satisfied\\n \\n Talkin’ and a-jokin’ about the world outside\\n \\n \\n \\n With haunted hearts through the heat and cold\\n \\n We never thought we could ever get old\\n \\n We thought we could sit forever in fun\\n \\n But our chances really was a million to one\\n \\n \\n \\n As easy it was to tell black from white\\n \\n It was all that easy to tell wrong from right\\n \\n And our choices were few and the thought never hit\\n \\n That the one road we traveled would ever shatter and split\\n \\n \\n \\n How many a year has passed and gone\\n \\n And many a gamble has been lost and won\\n \\n And many a road taken by many a friend\\n \\n And each one I’ve never seen again\\n \\n \\n \\n I wish, I wish, I wish in vain\\n \\n That we could sit simply in that room again\\n \\n Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat\\n \\n I’d give it all gladly if our lives could be like that\\n\\nHoney, just allow me one more chance\\n \\n To get along with you\\n \\n Honey, just allow me one more chance\\n \\n Ah’ll do anything with you\\n \\n Well, I’m a-walkin’ down the road\\n \\n With my head in my hand\\n \\n I’m lookin’ for a woman\\n \\n Needs a worried man\\n \\n Just-a one kind favor I ask you\\n \\n ’Low me just-a one more chance\\n \\n \\n \\n Honey, just allow me one more chance\\n \\n To ride your aeroplane\\n \\n Honey, just allow me one more chance\\n \\n To ride your passenger train\\n \\n Well, I’ve been lookin’ all over\\n \\n For a gal like you\\n \\n I can’t find nobody\\n \\n So you’ll have to do\\n \\n Just-a one kind favor I ask you\\n \\n ’Low me just-a one more chance\\n \\n \\n \\n Honey, just allow me one more chance\\n \\n To get along with you\\n \\n Honey, just allow me one more chance\\n \\n Ah’ll do anything with you\\n \\n Well, lookin’ for a woman\\n \\n That ain’t got no man\\n \\n Is just lookin’ for a needle\\n \\n That is lost in the sand\\n \\n Just-a one kind favor I ask you\\n \\n ’Low me just-a one more chance\\n\\nIt ain’t no use to sit and wonder why, babe\\n \\n It don’t matter, anyhow\\n \\n An’ it ain’t no use to sit and wonder why, babe\\n \\n If you don’t know by now\\n \\n When your rooster crows at the break of dawn\\n \\n Look out your window and I’ll be gone\\n \\n You’re the reason I’m trav’lin’ on\\n \\n Don’t think twice, it’s all right\\n \\n \\n \\n It ain’t no use in turnin’ on your light, babe\\n \\n That light I never knowed\\n \\n An’ it ain’t no use in turnin’ on your light, babe\\n \\n I’m on the dark side of the road\\n \\n Still I wish there was somethin’ you would do or say\\n \\n To try and make me change my mind and stay\\n \\n We never did too much talkin’ anyway\\n \\n So don’t think twice, it’s all right\\n \\n \\n \\n It ain’t no use in callin’ out my name, gal\\n \\n Like you never did before\\n \\n It ain’t no use in callin’ out my name, gal\\n \\n I can’t hear you anymore\\n \\n I’m a-thinkin’ and a-wond’rin’ all the way down the road\\n \\n I once loved a woman, a child I’m told\\n \\n I give her my heart but she wanted my soul\\n \\n But don’t think twice, it’s all right\\n \\n \\n \\n I’m walkin’ down that long, lonesome road, babe\\n \\n Where I’m bound, I can’t tell\\n \\n But goodbye’s too good a word, gal\\n \\n So I’ll just say fare thee well\\n \\n I ain’t sayin’ you treated me unkind\\n \\n You could have done better but I don’t mind\\n \\n You just kinda wasted my precious time\\n \\n But don’t think twice, it’s all right\\n\\nOld Reilly stole a stallion\\n\\nBut they caught him and they brought

bucket filled every season\\n \\n What with three babies born\\n \\n The work was cut down\\n \\n To a half a day’s shift with no reason\\n \\n \\n \\n Then the shaft was soon shut\\n \\n And more work was cut\\n \\n And the fire in the air, it felt frozen\\n \\n ’Til a man come to speak\\n \\n And he said in one week\\n \\n That number eleven was closin’\\n \\n \\n \\n They complained in the

blame\\n \\n He’s only a pawn in their game\\n \\n \\n \\n The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid\\n \\n And the marshals and cops get the same\\n \\n But the poor white man’s used in the hands of them all like a tool\\n \\n He’s taught in his school\\n \\n From the start by the rule\\n \\n That the laws are with him\\n \\n To protect his white skin\\n \\n To keep up his hate\\n \\n So he never thinks straight\\n \\n ’Bout the shape that he’s in\\n \\n But it ain’t him to blame\\n \\n He’s only a pawn in their game\\n \\n \\n \\n From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks\\n \\n And the hoofbeats pound in his brain\\n \\n And he’s taught how to walk in a pack\\n \\n Shoot in the back\\n \\n With his fist in a clinch\\n \\n To hang and to lynch\\n \\n To hide ’neath the hood\\n \\n To kill with no pain\\n \\n Like a dog on a chain\\n \\n He ain’t got no name\\n \\n But it ain’t him to blame\\n \\n He’s only a pawn in their game.\\n \\n \\n \\n

’way from my window\\n \\n Leave at your own chosen speed\\n \\n I’m not the one you want, babe\\n \\n I’m not the one you need\\n \\n You say you’re lookin’ for someone\\n \\n Never weak but always strong\\n \\n To protect you an’ defend you\\n \\n Whether you are right or wrong\\n \\n Someone to open each and every door\\n \\n But it ain’t me, babe\\n \\n No, no, no, it ain’t me, babe\\n \\n It

There’s nothing in here moving\\n \\n An’ anyway I’m not alone\\n \\n You say you’re lookin\\' for someone\\n \\n Who’ll pick you up each time you fall\\n \\n To gather flowers constantly\\n \\n An’ to come each time you call\\n \\n A lover for your life an’ nothing more\\n \\n But it ain’t me, babe\\n \\n No, no, no, it ain’t me, babe\\n \\n It ain’t me you’re lookin’ for, babe\\n\\nFar between sundown’s finish an’ midnight’s broken toll\\n \\n We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing\\n \\n As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds\\n \\n Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing\\n \\n Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight\\n \\n Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight\\n \\n An’ for each an’ ev’ry underdog soldier in the night\\n \\n An’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\\n \\n \\n \\n In the city’s melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched\\n \\n With faces hidden while the walls were tightening\\n \\n As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin’ rain\\n \\n Dissolved into the bells of the lightning\\n \\n Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake\\n \\n Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned an’ forsaked\\n \\n Tolling for the outcast, burnin’ constantly at stake\\n \\n An’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\\n \\n \\n \\n Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail\\n \\n The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder\\n \\n That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze\\n \\n Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder\\n \\n Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind\\n \\n Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind\\n \\n An’ the unpawned painter behind beyond his rightful time\\n \\n An’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\\n \\n \\n \\n Through the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales\\n \\n For the disrobed faceless forms of no position\\n \\n Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts\\n \\n All down in taken-for-granted situations\\n \\n Tolling for the deaf an’ blind, tolling for the mute\\n \\n Tolling for the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute\\n \\n For the misdemeanor outlaw, chased an’ cheated by pursuit\\n \\n An’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\\n \\n \\n \\n Even though a cloud’s white curtain in a far-off corner flashed\\n \\n An’ the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting\\n \\n Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones\\n \\n Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting\\n \\n Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail\\n \\n For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale\\n \\n An’ for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail\\n \\n An’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\\n \\n \\n \\n Starry-eyed an’ laughing as I recall when we were caught\\n \\n Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended\\n \\n As we listened one last time an’ we watched with one last look\\n \\n Spellbound an’ swallowed ’til the tolling ended\\n \\n Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed\\n \\n For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an’ worse\\n \\n An’ for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe\\n \\n An’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\\n\\nOh all the money that in my whole life I did spend\\n \\n Be it mine right or wrongfully\\n \\n I let it slip gladly past the hands of my friends\\n \\n To tie up the time most forcefully\\n \\n But the bottles are done\\n \\n We’ve killed each one\\n \\n And the table’s full and overflowed\\n \\n And the corner sign\\n \\n Says it’s closing time\\n \\n So I’ll bid farewell and be down the road\\n \\n \\n \\n Oh ev’ry girl that ever I’ve touched\\n \\n I did not do it harmfully\\n \\n And ev’ry girl that ever I’ve hurt\\n \\n I did not do it knowin’ly\\n \\n But to remain as friends\\n \\n And make amends\\n \\n You need the time and stay behind\\n \\n And since my feet are now fast\\n \\n And point away from the past\\n \\n I’ll bid farewell and be down the line\\n \\n \\n \\n Oh ev’ry foe that ever I faced\\n \\n The cause was there before we came\\n \\n And ev’ry cause that ever I fought\\n \\n I fought it full without regret or shame\\n \\n But the dark does die\\n \\n As the curtain is drawn and somebody’s eyes\\n \\n Must meet the dawn\\n \\n And if I see the day\\n \\n I’d only have to stay\\n \\n So I’ll bid farewell in the night and be gone\\n \\n \\n \\n Oh, ev’ry thought that’s strung a knot in my mind\\n \\n I might go insane if it couldn’t be sprung\\n \\n But it’s not to stand naked under unknowin’ eyes\\n \\n It’s for myself and my friends my stories are sung\\n \\n But the time ain’t tall, yet on time you depend\\n \\n And no word is possessed by no special friend\\n \\n And though the line is cut\\n \\n It ain’t quite the end\\n \\n I’ll just bid farewell till we meet again\\n \\n \\n \\n Oh a false clock tries to tick out my time\\n \\n To disgrace, distract, and bother me\\n \\n And the dirt of gossip blows into my face\\n \\n And the dust of rumors covers me\\n \\n But if the arrow is straight\\n \\n And the point is slick\\n \\n It can pierce through dust no matter how thick\\n \\n So I’ll make my stand\\n \\n And remain as I am\\n \\n And bid farewell and not give a damn\\n\\nI woke in the mornin’, wand’rin’\\n \\n Wasted and worn out\\n \\n I woke in the mornin’, wand’rin’\\n \\n Wasted and worn out\\n \\n Wishin’ my long-lost lover\\n \\n Will walk to me, talk to me\\n \\n Tell me what it’s all about\\n \\n \\n \\n I was standin’ at the side road\\n \\n Listenin’ to the billboard knock\\n \\n Standin’ at the side road\\n \\n Listenin’ to the billboard knock\\n \\n Well, my wrist was empty\\n \\n But my nerves were kickin’\\n \\n Tickin’ like a clock\\n \\n \\n \\n If I got anything you need, babe\\n \\n Let me tell you in front\\n \\n If I got anything you need, babe\\n \\n Let me tell you in front\\n \\n You can come to me sometime\\n \\n Night time, day time\\n \\n Any time you want\\n \\n \\n \\n Sometimes I’m thinkin’ I’m\\n \\n Too high to fall\\n \\n Sometimes I’m thinkin’ I’m\\n \\n Too high to fall\\n \\n Other times I’m thinkin’ I’m\\n \\n So low I don’t know\\n \\n If I can come up at all\\n \\n \\n \\n Black crows in the meadow\\n \\n Across a broad highway\\n \\n Black crows in the meadow\\n \\n Across a broad highway\\n \\n Though it’s funny, honey\\n \\n I just don’t feel much like a\\n \\n Scarecrow today\\n\\nGypsy gal, the hands of Harlem\\n \\n Cannot hold you to its heat\\n \\n Your temperature’s too hot for taming\\n \\n Your flaming feet burn up the street\\n \\n I am homeless, come and take me\\n \\n Into reach of your rattling drums\\n \\n Let me know, babe, about my fortune\\n \\n Down along my restless palms\\n \\n \\n \\n Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed\\n \\n I have fallen far beneath\\n \\n Your pearly eyes, so fast an’ slashing\\n \\n An’ your flashing diamond teeth\\n \\n The night is pitch black, come an’ make my\\n \\n Pale face fit into place, ah, please!\\n \\n Let me know, babe, I’m nearly drowning\\n \\n If it’s you my lifelines trace\\n \\n \\n \\n I been wond’rin’ all about me\\n \\n Ever since I seen you there\\n \\n On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I’m riding\\n \\n I know I’m ’round you but I don’t know where\\n \\n You have slayed me, you have made me\\n \\n I got to laugh halfways off my heels\\n \\n I got to know, babe, will you surround me?\\n \\n So I can tell if I’m really real\\n\\nI once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze\\n \\n With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn\\n \\n I courted her proudly but now she is gone\\n \\n Gone as the season she’s taken\\n \\n \\n \\n Through young summer’s breeze, I stole her away\\n \\n From her mother and sister, though close did they stay\\n \\n Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day\\n \\n With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us\\n \\n \\n \\n Of the two sisters, I loved the young\\n \\n With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one\\n \\n The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone\\n \\n By the jealousy of others around her\\n \\n \\n \\n For her parasite sister, I had no respect\\n \\n Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect\\n \\n Countless visions of the other she’d reflect\\n \\n As a crutch for her scenes and her society\\n \\n \\n \\n Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused\\n \\n The changes I was going through can’t even be used\\n \\n For the lies that I told her in hopes not to lose\\n \\n The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime\\n \\n \\n \\n With unknown consciousness, I possessed in my grip\\n \\n A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped\\n \\n Noticing not that I’d already slipped\\n \\n To a sin of love’s false security\\n \\n \\n \\n From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace\\n \\n Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies\\n \\n Till the tombstones of damage read me no questions but, “Please\\n \\n What’s wrong and what’s exactly the matter?”\\n \\n \\n \\n And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen\\n \\n The timeless explosion of fantasy’s dream\\n \\n At the peak of the night, the king and the queen\\n \\n Tumbled all down into pieces\\n \\n \\n \\n “The tragic figure!” her sister did shout\\n \\n “Leave her alone, God damn you, get out!”\\n \\n And I in my armor, turning about\\n \\n And nailing her to the ruins of her pettiness\\n \\n \\n \\n Beneath a bare lightbulb the plaster did pound\\n \\n Her sister and I in a screaming battleground\\n \\n And she in between, the victim of sound\\n \\n Soon shattered as a child ’neath her shadows\\n \\n \\n \\n All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight\\n \\n I gagged twice, doubled, tears blinding my sight\\n \\n My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night\\n \\n Leaving all of love’s ashes behind me\\n \\n \\n \\n The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet\\n \\n The words to say I’m sorry, I haven’t found yet\\n \\n I think of her often and hope whoever she’s met\\n \\n Will be fully aware of how precious she is\\n \\n \\n \\n Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me\\n \\n “How good, how good does it feel to be free?”\\n \\n And I answer them most mysteriously\\n \\n “Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?”\\n\\nI’m just average, common too\\n \\n I’m just like him, the same as you\\n \\n I’m everybody’s brother and son\\n \\n I ain’t different from anyone\\n \\n It ain’t no use a-talking to me\\n \\n It’s just the same as talking to you\\n \\n \\n \\n I was shadow-boxing earlier in the day\\n \\n I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay\\n \\n I said “Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come\\n \\n 26, 27, 28, 29, I’m gonna make your face look just like mine\\n \\n Five, four, three, two, one, Cassius Clay you’d better run\\n \\n 99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won’t even recognize you\\n \\n 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen”\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I don’t know, but I’ve been told\\n \\n The streets in heaven are lined with gold\\n \\n I ask you how things could get much worse\\n \\n If the Russians happen to get up there first\\n \\n Wowee! pretty scary!\\n \\n \\n \\n Now, I’m liberal, but to a degree\\n \\n I want ev’rybody to be free\\n \\n But if you think that I’ll let Barry Goldwater\\n \\n Move in next door and marry my daughter\\n \\n You must think I’m crazy!\\n \\n I wouldn’t let him do it for all the farms in Cuba\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I set my monkey on the log\\n \\n And ordered him to do the Dog\\n \\n He wagged his tail and shook his head\\n \\n And he went and did the Cat instead\\n \\n He’s a weird monkey, very funky\\n \\n \\n \\n I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on\\n \\n Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun\\n \\n I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist\\n \\n And my wig-hat was falling in my face\\n \\n But they wouldn’t let me on the tennis court\\n \\n \\n \\n I got a woman, she’s so mean\\n \\n She sticks my boots in the washing machine\\n \\n Sticks me with buckshot when I’m nude\\n \\n Puts bubblegum in my food\\n \\n She’s funny, wants my money, calls me “honey”\\n \\n \\n \\n Now I got a friend who spends his life\\n \\n Stabbing my picture with a bowie knife\\n \\n Dreams of strangling me with a scarf\\n \\n When my name comes up he pretends to barf\\n \\n I’ve got a million friends!\\n \\n \\n \\n Now they asked me to read a poem\\n \\n At the sorority sisters’ home\\n \\n I got knocked down and my head was swimmin’\\n \\n I wound up with the Dean of Women\\n \\n Yippee! I’m a poet, and I know it\\n \\n Hope I don’t blow it\\n \\n \\n \\n I’m gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange\\n \\n So I look like a walking mountain range\\n \\n And I’m gonna ride into Omaha on a horse\\n \\n Out to the country club and the golf course\\n \\n Carry The New York Times, shoot a few holes, blow their minds\\n \\n \\n \\n Now you’re probably wondering by now\\n \\n Just what this song is all about\\n \\n What’s probably got you baffled more\\n \\n Is what this thing here is for\\n \\n It’s nothing\\n \\n It’s something I learned over in England\\n\\nRamona\\n \\n Come closer\\n \\n Shut softly your watery eyes\\n \\n The pangs of your sadness\\n \\n Shall pass as your senses will rise\\n \\n The flowers of the city\\n \\n Though breathlike\\n \\n Get deathlike at times\\n \\n And there’s no use in tryin’\\n \\n T’ deal with the dyin’\\n \\n Though I cannot explain that in lines\\n \\n \\n \\n Your cracked country lips\\n \\n I still wish to kiss\\n \\n As to be under the strength of your skin\\n \\n Your magnetic movements\\n \\n Still capture the minutes I’m in\\n \\n But it grieves my heart, love\\n \\n To see you tryin’ to be a part of\\n \\n A world that just don’t exist\\n \\n It’s all just a dream, babe\\n \\n A vacuum, a scheme, babe\\n \\n That sucks you into feelin’ like this\\n \\n \\n \\n I can see that your head\\n \\n Has been twisted and fed\\n \\n By worthless foam from the mouth\\n \\n I can tell you are torn\\n \\n Between stayin’ and returnin’\\n \\n On back to the South\\n \\n You’ve been fooled into thinking\\n \\n That the finishin’ end is at hand\\n \\n Yet there’s no one to beat you\\n \\n No one t’ defeat you\\n \\n ’Cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad\\n \\n \\n \\n I’ve heard you say many times\\n \\n That you’re better ’n no one\\n \\n And no one is better ’n you\\n \\n If you really believe that\\n \\n You know you got\\n \\n Nothing to win and nothing to lose\\n \\n From fixtures and forces and friends\\n \\n Your sorrow does stem\\n \\n That hype you and type you\\n \\n Making you feel\\n \\n That you must be exactly like them\\n \\n \\n \\n I’d forever talk to you\\n \\n But soon my words\\n \\n They would turn into a meaningless ring\\n \\n For deep in my heart\\n \\n I know there is no help I can bring\\n \\n Everything passes\\n \\n Everything changes\\n \\n Just do what you think you should do\\n \\n And someday maybe\\n \\n Who knows, baby\\n \\n I’ll come and be cryin’ to you\\n\\nI pounded on a farmhouse\\n \\n Lookin’ for a place to stay\\n \\n I was mighty, mighty tired\\n \\n I had come a long, long way\\n \\n I said, “Hey, hey, in there\\n \\n Is there anybody home?”\\n \\n I was standin’ on the steps\\n \\n Feelin’ most alone\\n \\n Well, out comes a farmer\\n \\n He must have thought that I was nuts\\n \\n He immediately looked at me\\n \\n And stuck a gun into my guts\\n \\n \\n \\n I fell down\\n \\n To my bended knees\\n \\n Saying, “I dig farmers\\n \\n Don’t shoot me, please!”\\n \\n He cocked his rifle\\n \\n And began to shout\\n \\n “You’re that travelin’ salesman\\n \\n That I have heard about”\\n \\n I said, “No! No! No!\\n \\n I’m a doctor and it’s true\\n \\n I’m a clean-cut kid\\n \\n And I been to college, too”\\n \\n \\n \\n Then in comes his daughter\\n \\n Whose name was Rita\\n \\n She looked like she stepped out of\\n \\n La Dolce Vita\\n \\n I immediately tried to cool it\\n \\n With her dad\\n \\n And told him what a\\n \\n Nice, pretty farm he had\\n \\n He said, “What do doctors\\n \\n Know about farms, pray tell?”\\n \\n I said, “I was born\\n \\n At the bottom of a wishing well”\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, by the dirt ’neath my nails\\n \\n I guess he knew I wouldn’t lie\\n \\n “I guess you’re tired”\\n \\n He said, kinda sly\\n \\n I said, “Yes, ten thousand miles\\n \\n Today I drove”\\n \\n He said, “I got a bed for you\\n \\n Underneath the stove\\n \\n Just one condition\\n \\n And you go to sleep right now\\n \\n That you don’t touch my daughter\\n \\n And in the morning, milk the cow”\\n \\n \\n \\n I was sleepin’ like a rat\\n \\n When I heard something jerkin’\\n \\n There stood Rita\\n \\n Lookin’ just like Tony Perkins\\n \\n She said, “Would you like to take a shower?\\n \\n I’ll show you up to the door”\\n \\n I said, “Oh, no! no!\\n \\n I’ve been through this before”\\n \\n I knew I had to split\\n \\n But I didn’t know how\\n \\n When she said\\n \\n “Would you like to take that shower, now?”\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I couldn’t leave\\n \\n Unless the old man chased me out\\n \\n ’Cause I’d already promised\\n \\n That I’d milk his cows\\n \\n I had to say something\\n \\n To strike him very weird\\n \\n So I yelled out\\n \\n “I like Fidel Castro and his beard”\\n \\n Rita looked offended\\n \\n But she got out of the way\\n \\n As he came charging down the stairs\\n \\n Sayin’, “What’s that I heard you say?”\\n \\n \\n \\n I said, “I like Fidel Castro\\n \\n I think you heard me right”\\n \\n And ducked as he swung\\n \\n At me with all his might\\n \\n Rita mumbled something\\n \\n ’Bout her mother on the hill\\n \\n As his fist hit the icebox\\n \\n He said he’s going to kill me\\n \\n If I don’t get out the door\\n \\n In two seconds flat\\n \\n “You unpatriotic\\n \\n Rotten doctor Commie rat”\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, he threw a Reader’s Digest\\n \\n At my head and I did run\\n \\n I did a somersault\\n \\n As I seen him get his gun\\n \\n And crashed through the window\\n \\n At a hundred miles an hour\\n \\n And landed fully blast\\n \\n In his garden flowers\\n \\n Rita said, “Come back!”\\n \\n As he started to load\\n \\n The sun was comin’ up\\n \\n And I was runnin’ down the road\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I don’t figure I’ll be back\\n \\n There for a spell\\n \\n Even though Rita moved away\\n \\n And got a job in a motel\\n \\n He still waits for me\\n \\n Constant, on the sly\\n \\n He wants to turn me in\\n \\n To the F.B.I.\\n \\n Me, I romp and stomp\\n \\n Thankful as I romp\\n \\n Without freedom of speech\\n \\n I might be in the swamp\\n\\nI can’t understand\\n \\n She let go of my hand\\n \\n An’ left me here facing the wall\\n \\n I’d sure like t’ know\\n \\n Why she did go\\n \\n But I can’t get close t’ her at all\\n \\n Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime\\n \\n She said she would never forget\\n \\n But now mornin’s clear\\n \\n It’s like I ain’t here\\n \\n She just acts like we never have met\\n \\n \\n \\n It’s all new t’ me\\n \\n Like some mystery\\n \\n It could even be like a myth\\n \\n Yet it’s hard t’ think on\\n \\n That she’s the same one\\n \\n That last night I was with\\n \\n From darkness, dreams’re deserted\\n \\n Am I still dreamin’ yet?\\n \\n I wish she’d unlock\\n \\n Her voice once an’ talk\\n \\n ’Stead of acting like we never have met\\n \\n \\n \\n If she ain’t feelin’ well\\n \\n Then why don’t she tell\\n \\n ’Stead of turnin’ her back t’ my face?\\n \\n Without any doubt\\n \\n She seems too far out\\n \\n For me t’ return t’ her chase\\n \\n Though the night ran swirling an’ whirling\\n \\n I remember her whispering yet\\n \\n But evidently she don’t\\n \\n An’ evidently she won’t\\n \\n She just acts like we never have met\\n \\n \\n \\n If I didn’t have t’ guess\\n \\n I’d gladly confess\\n \\n T’ anything I might’ve tried\\n \\n If I was with ’er too long\\n \\n Or have done something wrong\\n \\n I wish she’d tell me what it is, I’ll run an’ hide\\n \\n Though her skirt it swayed as a guitar played\\n \\n Her mouth was watery and wet\\n \\n But now something has changed\\n \\n For she ain’t the same\\n \\n She just acts like we never have met\\n \\n \\n \\n I’m leavin’ today\\n \\n I’ll be on my way\\n \\n Of this I can’t say very much\\n \\n But if you want me to\\n \\n I can be just like you\\n \\n An’ pretend that we never have touched\\n \\n An’ if anybody asks me\\n \\n “Is it easy to forget?”\\n \\n I’ll say, “It’s easily done\\n \\n You just pick anyone\\n \\n An’ pretend that you never have met!”\\n\\nCome gather ’round people\\n \\n Wherever you roam\\n \\n And admit that the waters\\n \\n Around you have grown\\n \\n And accept it that soon\\n \\n You’ll be drenched to the bone\\n \\n If your time to you is worth savin’\\n \\n Then you better start swimmin’ or you’ll sink like a stone\\n \\n For the times they are a-changin’\\n \\n \\n \\n Come writers and critics\\n \\n Who prophesize with your pen\\n \\n And keep your eyes wide\\n \\n The chance won’t come again\\n \\n And don’t speak too soon\\n \\n For the wheel’s still in spin\\n \\n And there’s no tellin’ who that it’s namin’\\n \\n For the loser now will be later to win\\n \\n For the times they are a-changin’\\n \\n \\n \\n Come senators, congressmen\\n \\n Please heed the call\\n \\n Don’t stand in the doorway\\n \\n Don’t block up the hall\\n \\n For he that gets hurt\\n \\n Will be he who has stalled\\n \\n There’s a battle outside and it is ragin’\\n \\n It’ll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls\\n \\n For the times they are a-changin’\\n \\n \\n \\n Come mothers and fathers\\n \\n Throughout the land\\n \\n And don’t criticize\\n \\n What you can’t understand\\n \\n Your sons and your daughters\\n \\n Are beyond your command\\n \\n Your old road is rapidly agin’\\n \\n Please get out of the new one if you can’t lend your hand\\n \\n For the times they are a-changin’\\n \\n \\n \\n The line it is drawn\\n \\n The curse it is cast\\n \\n The slow one now\\n \\n Will later be fast\\n \\n As the present now\\n \\n Will later be past\\n \\n The order is rapidly fadin’\\n \\n And the first one now will later be last\\n \\n For the times they are a-changin’\\n\\nYou walk into the room\\n \\n With your pencil in your hand\\n \\n You see somebody naked\\n \\n And you say, “Who is that man?”\\n \\n You try so hard\\n \\n But you don’t understand\\n \\n Just what you’ll say\\n \\n When you get home\\n \\n \\n \\n Because something is happening here\\n \\n But you don’t know what it is\\n \\n Do you, Mister Jones?\\n \\n \\n \\n You raise up your head\\n \\n And you ask, “Is this where it is?”\\n \\n And somebody points to you and says\\n \\n “It’s his”\\n \\n And you say, “What’s mine?”\\n \\n And somebody else says, “Where what is?”\\n \\n And you say, “Oh my God\\n \\n Am I here all alone?”\\n \\n \\n \\n Because something is happening here\\n \\n But you don’t know what it is\\n \\n Do you, Mister Jones?\\n \\n \\n \\n You hand in your ticket\\n \\n And you go watch the geek\\n \\n Who immediately walks up to you\\n \\n When he hears you speak\\n \\n And says, “How does it feel\\n \\n To be such a freak?”\\n \\n And you say, “Impossible”\\n \\n As he hands you a bone\\n \\n \\n \\n Because something is happening here\\n \\n But you don’t know what it is\\n \\n Do you, Mister Jones?\\n \\n \\n \\n You have many contacts\\n \\n Among the lumberjacks\\n \\n To get you facts\\n \\n When someone attacks your imagination\\n \\n But nobody has any respect\\n \\n Anyway they already expect you\\n \\n To just give a check\\n \\n To tax-deductible charity organizations\\n \\n \\n \\n You’ve been with the professors\\n \\n And they’ve all liked your looks\\n \\n With great lawyers you have\\n \\n Discussed lepers and crooks\\n \\n You’ve been through all of\\n \\n F. Scott Fitzgerald’s books\\n \\n You’re very well read\\n \\n It’s well known\\n \\n \\n \\n Because something is happening here\\n \\n But you don’t know what it is\\n \\n Do you, Mister Jones?\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you\\n \\n And then he kneels\\n \\n He crosses himself\\n \\n And then he clicks his high heels\\n \\n And without further notice\\n \\n He asks you how it feels\\n \\n And he says, “Here is your throat back\\n \\n Thanks for the loan”\\n \\n \\n \\n Because something is happening here\\n \\n But you don’t know what it is\\n \\n Do you, Mister Jones?\\n \\n \\n \\n Now you see this one-eyed midget\\n \\n Shouting the word “NOW”\\n \\n And you say, “For what reason?”\\n \\n And he says, “How?”\\n \\n And you say, “What does this mean?”\\n \\n And he screams back, “You’re a cow\\n \\n Give me some milk\\n \\n Or else go home”\\n \\n \\n \\n Because something is happening here\\n \\n But you don’t know what it is\\n \\n Do you, Mister Jones?\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, you walk into the room\\n \\n Like a camel and then you frown\\n \\n You put your eyes in your pocket\\n \\n And your nose on the ground\\n \\n There ought to be a law\\n \\n Against you comin’ around\\n \\n You should be made\\n \\n To wear earphones\\n \\n \\n \\n Because something is happening here\\n \\n But you don’t know what it is\\n \\n Do you, Mister Jones?\\n\\nAin’t it hard to stumble\\n \\n And land in some funny lagoon?\\n \\n Ain’t it hard to stumble\\n \\n And land in some muddy lagoon?\\n \\n Especially when it’s nine below zero\\n \\n And

\\n My love she laughs like the flowers\\n \\n Valentines can’t buy her\\n \\n \\n \\n In the dime stores and bus stations\\n \\n People talk of situations\\n \\n Read books, repeat quotations\\n \\n Draw conclusions on the wall\\n \\n Some speak of the future\\n \\n My love she speaks softly\\n \\n She knows there’s no success like failure\\n \\n And that failure’s no success at all\\n \\n \\n \\n The cloak and dagger dangles\\n \\n Madams light the candles\\n \\n In ceremonies of the horsemen\\n \\n Even the pawn must hold a grudge\\n \\n Statues made of matchsticks\\n \\n Crumble into one another\\n \\n My love winks, she does not bother\\n \\n She knows too much to argue or to judge\\n \\n \\n \\n The bridge at midnight trembles\\n \\n The country doctor rambles\\n \\n Bankers’ nieces seek perfection\\n \\n Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring\\n \\n The wind howls like a hammer\\n \\n The night blows cold and rainy\\n \\n My love she’s like some raven\\n \\n At my window with a broken wing\\n\\nShe’s got everything she needs\\n \\n She’s an artist, she don’t look back\\n \\n She’s got everything she needs\\n \\n She’s an artist, she don’t look back\\n \\n She can take

Bette Davis style\\n \\n And in comes Romeo, he’s moaning\\n \\n “You Belong to Me I Believe”\\n \\n And someone says, “You’re in the wrong place my friend\\n \\n You better leave”\\n \\n And the only sound that’s left\\n \\n After the ambulances go\\n \\n Is Cinderella sweeping up\\n \\n On Desolation Row\\n \\n \\n \\n Now the moon is almost hidden\\n \\n The stars are beginning to hide\\n \\n The fortune-telling lady\\n \\n Has even taken all her things inside\\n \\n All except for Cain and Abel\\n \\n And the hunchback of Notre Dame\\n \\n Everybody is making love\\n \\n Or else expecting rain\\n \\n And the Good Samaritan, he’s dressing\\n \\n He’s getting ready for the show\\n \\n He’s going to the carnival tonight\\n \\n On Desolation Row\\n \\n \\n \\n Now Ophelia, she’s ’neath the window\\n \\n For her I feel so afraid\\n \\n On her twenty-second birthday\\n \\n She already is an old maid\\n \\n To her, death is quite romantic\\n \\n She wears an iron vest\\n \\n Her profession’s her religion\\n \\n Her sin is her lifelessness\\n \\n And though her eyes are fixed upon\\n \\n Noah’s great rainbow\\n \\n She spends her time peeking\\n \\n Into Desolation Row\\n \\n \\n \\n Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood\\n \\n With his memories in a trunk\\n \\n Passed this way an hour ago\\n \\n With his friend, a jealous monk\\n \\n He looked so immaculately frightful\\n \\n As he bummed a cigarette\\n \\n Then he went off sniffing drainpipes\\n \\n And reciting the alphabet\\n \\n Now you would not think to look at him\\n \\n But he was famous long ago\\n \\n For playing the electric violin\\n \\n On Desolation Row\\n \\n \\n \\n Dr. Filth, he keeps his world\\n \\n Inside of a leather cup\\n \\n But all his sexless patients\\n \\n They’re trying to blow it up\\n \\n Now his nurse, some local loser\\n \\n She’s in charge of the cyanide hole\\n \\n And she also keeps the cards that read\\n \\n “Have Mercy on His Soul”\\n \\n They all play on pennywhistles\\n \\n You can hear them blow\\n \\n If you lean your head out far enough\\n \\n From Desolation Row\\n \\n \\n \\n Across the street they’ve nailed the curtains\\n \\n They’re getting ready for the feast\\n \\n The Phantom of the Opera\\n \\n A perfect image of a priest\\n \\n They’re spoonfeeding Casanova\\n \\n To get him to feel more assured\\n \\n Then they’ll kill him with self-confidence\\n \\n After poisoning him with words\\n \\n And the Phantom’s shouting to skinny girls\\n \\n “Get Outa Here If You Don’t Know\\n \\n Casanova is just being punished for going\\n \\n To Desolation Row”\\n \\n \\n \\n Now at midnight all the agents\\n \\n And the superhuman crew\\n \\n Come out and round up everyone\\n \\n That knows more than they do\\n \\n Then they bring them to the factory\\n \\n Where the heart-attack machine\\n \\n Is strapped across their shoulders\\n \\n And then the kerosene\\n \\n Is brought down from the castles\\n \\n By insurance men who go\\n \\n Check to see that nobody is escaping\\n \\n To Desolation Row\\n \\n \\n \\n Praise be to Nero’s Neptune\\n \\n The Titanic sails at dawn\\n \\n And everybody’s shouting\\n \\n “Which Side Are You On?”\\n \\n And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot\\n \\n Fighting in the captain’s tower\\n \\n While calypso singers laugh at them\\n \\n And fishermen hold flowers\\n \\n Between the windows of the sea\\n \\n Where lovely mermaids flow\\n \\n And nobody has to think too much\\n \\n About Desolation Row\\n \\n \\n \\n Yes, I received your letter yesterday\\n \\n (About the time the doorknob broke)\\n \\n When you asked how I was doing\\n

Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I’m lost on the river bridge\\n \\n I’m cracked up on the highway and on the water’s edge\\n \\n She comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with thread\\n \\n Well, if I go down dyin’, you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed.\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, she don’t make me nervous, she don’t talk too much\\n \\n She walks like Bo Diddley and she don’t need no crutch\\n \\n She keeps this four-ten all loaded with lead\\n \\n Well, if I go down dyin’, you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed.\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, you know I need a steam shovel mama to keep away the dead\\n \\n I need a dump truck mama to unload my head\\n \\n She brings me everything and more, and just like I said\\n \\n Well, if I go down dyin’, you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed.\\n\\nI paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents\\n\\nI paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents\\n\\nSee my hound dog bite a

yuh understand\\n \\n Who came running to the deck\\n \\n Said, “Boys, forget the whale\\n \\n Look on over yonder\\n \\n Cut the engines\\n \\n Change the sail\\n \\n Haul on the bowline”\\n \\n We sang that melody\\n \\n Like all tough sailors do\\n \\n When they are far away at sea\\n \\n \\n \\n “I think I’ll call it America”\\n \\n I said as we hit land\\n \\n I took a deep breath\\n \\n I fell down, I could not stand\\n \\n Captain Arab he started\\n \\n Writing up some deeds\\n \\n He said, “Let’s set up a fort\\n \\n And start buying the place with beads”\\n \\n Just then this cop comes down the street\\n \\n Crazy as a loon\\n \\n He throw us all in jail\\n \\n For carryin’ harpoons\\n \\n \\n \\n Ah me I busted out\\n \\n Don’t even ask me how\\n \\n I went to get some help\\n \\n I walked by a Guernsey cow\\n \\n Who directed me down\\n \\n To the Bowery slums\\n \\n Where people carried signs around\\n \\n Saying, “Ban the bums”\\n \\n I jumped right into line\\n \\n Sayin’, “I hope that I’m not late”\\n \\n When I realized I hadn’t eaten\\n \\n For five days straight\\n \\n \\n \\n I went into a restaurant\\n \\n Lookin’ for the cook\\n \\n I told them I was the editor\\n \\n Of a famous etiquette book\\n \\n The waitress he was handsome\\n \\n He wore a powder blue cape\\n \\n I ordered some suzette, I said\\n \\n “Could you please make that crepe”\\n \\n Just then the whole kitchen exploded\\n \\n From boilin’ fat\\n \\n Food was flying everywhere\\n \\n And I left without my hat\\n \\n \\n \\n Now, I didn’t mean to be nosy\\n \\n But I went into a bank\\n \\n To get some bail for Arab\\n \\n And all the boys back in the tank\\n \\n They asked me for some collateral\\n \\n And I pulled down my pants\\n \\n They threw me in the alley\\n \\n When up comes this girl from France\\n \\n Who invited me to her house\\n \\n I went, but she had a friend\\n \\n Who knocked me out\\n \\n And robbed my boots\\n \\n And I was on the street again\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I rapped upon a house\\n \\n With the U.S. flag upon display\\n \\n I said, “Could you help me out\\n \\n I got some friends down the way”\\n \\n The man says, “Get out of here\\n \\n I’ll tear you limb from limb”\\n \\n I said, “You know they refused Jesus, too”\\n \\n He said, “You’re not Him\\n \\n Get out of here before I break your bones\\n \\n I ain’t your pop”\\n \\n I decided to have him arrested\\n \\n And I went looking for a cop\\n \\n \\n \\n I ran right outside\\n \\n And I hopped inside a cab\\n \\n I went out the other door\\n \\n This Englishman said, “Fab”\\n \\n As he saw me leap a hot dog stand\\n \\n And a chariot that stood\\n \\n Parked across from a building\\n \\n Advertising brotherhood\\n \\n I ran right through the front door\\n \\n Like a hobo sailor does\\n \\n But it was just a funeral parlor\\n \\n And the man asked me who I was\\n \\n \\n \\n I repeated that my friends\\n \\n Were all in jail, with a sigh\\n \\n He gave me his card\\n \\n He said, “Call me if they die”\\n \\n I shook his hand and said goodbye\\n \\n Ran out to the street\\n \\n When a bowling ball came down the road\\n \\n And knocked me off my feet\\n \\n A pay phone was ringing\\n \\n It just about blew my mind\\n \\n When I picked it up and said hello\\n \\n This foot came through the line\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, by this time I was fed up\\n \\n At tryin’ to make a stab\\n \\n At bringin’ back any help\\n \\n For my friends and Captain Arab\\n \\n I decided to flip a coin\\n \\n Like either heads or tails\\n \\n Would let me know if I should go\\n \\n Back to ship or back to jail\\n \\n So I hocked my sailor suit\\n \\n And I got a coin to flip\\n \\n It came up tails\\n \\n It rhymed with sails\\n \\n So I made it back to the ship\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I got back and took\\n \\n The parkin’ ticket off the mast\\n \\n I was ripping it to shreds\\n \\n When this coastguard boat went past\\n \\n They asked me my name\\n \\n And I said, “Captain Kidd”\\n \\n They believed me but\\n \\n They wanted to know\\n \\n What exactly that I did\\n \\n I said for the Pope of Eruke\\n \\n I was employed\\n \\n They let me go right away\\n \\n They were very paranoid\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, the last I heard of Arab\\n \\n He was stuck on a whale\\n \\n That was married to the deputy\\n \\n Sheriff of the jail\\n \\n But the funniest thing was\\n \\n When I was leavin’ the bay\\n \\n I saw three ships a-sailin’\\n \\n They were all heading my way\\n \\n I asked the captain what his name was\\n \\n And how come he didn’t drive a truck\\n \\n He said his name was Columbus\\n \\n I just said, “Good luck”\\n\\nI ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more\\n \\n No, I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more\\n \\n Well, I wake in the

dime\\n \\n He asks you with a grin\\n \\n If you’re havin’ a good time\\n \\n Then he fines you every time you slam the door\\n \\n I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s brother no more\\n \\n \\n \\n I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s pa no more\\n \\n No, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s pa no more\\n \\n Well, he puts his cigar\\n \\n Out in your face just for kicks\\n \\n His bedroom window\\n \\n It is made out of bricks\\n \\n The National Guard stands around his door\\n \\n Ah, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s pa no more\\n \\n \\n \\n I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s ma no more\\n \\n No, I

\\n Well, I try my best\\n \\n To be just like I am\\n \\n But everybody wants you\\n \\n To be just like them\\n \\n They sing while you slave and I just get bored\\n \\n I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more\\n\\nWhen she said\\n \\n “Don’t waste your words, they’re just lies”\\n \\n I cried she was deaf\\n \\n And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes\\n \\n Then said, “What else you got left?”\\n \\n It was then that I got up to leave\\n \\n But she said, “Don’t forget\\n \\n Everybody must give something back\\n \\n For something they get”\\n \\n \\n \\n I stood there and hummed\\n \\n I tapped on her drum and asked her how come\\n \\n And she buttoned her boot\\n \\n And straightened her suit\\n \\n Then she said, “Don’t get cute”\\n \\n So I forced my hands in my pockets\\n \\n And felt with my thumbs\\n \\n And gallantly handed her\\n \\n My very last piece of gum\\n \\n \\n \\n She threw me outside\\n \\n I stood in the dirt where ev’ryone walked\\n \\n And after finding I’d\\n \\n Forgotten my shirt\\n \\n I went back and knocked\\n \\n I waited in the hallway, she went to get it\\n \\n And I tried to make sense\\n \\n Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair\\n \\n That leaned up against . . .\\n \\n \\n \\n Her Jamaican rum\\n \\n And when she did come, I asked her for some\\n \\n She said, “No, dear”\\n \\n I said, “Your words aren’t clear\\n \\n You’d better spit out your gum”\\n \\n She screamed till her face got so red\\n \\n Then she fell on the floor\\n \\n And I covered her up and then\\n \\n Thought I’d go look through her drawer\\n \\n \\n \\n And when I was through\\n \\n I filled up my shoe\\n \\n And brought it to you\\n \\n And you, you took me in\\n \\n You loved me then\\n \\n You didn’t waste time\\n \\n And I, I never took much\\n \\n I never asked for your crutch\\n \\n Now don’t ask for mine\\n\\nEarly in the mornin’\\n \\n Early in the mornin’\\n \\n I’m callin’ you to\\n \\n I’m callin’ you to\\n \\n Please come home\\n \\n Yes, I guess I could make it without you\\n \\n If I just didn’t feel so all alone\\n \\n \\n \\n Don’t let me down\\n \\n Don’t let me down\\n \\n I won’t let you down\\n \\n I won’t let you down\\n \\n No I won’t\\n \\n You know I can if you can, honey\\n \\n But, honey, please don’t\\n \\n \\n \\n I got my black dog barkin’\\n \\n Black dog barkin’\\n \\n Yes it is now\\n \\n Yes it is now\\n \\n Outside my yard\\n \\n Yes, I could tell you what he means\\n \\n If I just didn’t have to try so hard\\n \\n \\n \\n Your mama’s workin’\\n \\n Your mama’s moanin’\\n \\n She’s cryin’ you know\\n \\n She’s tryin’ you know\\n \\n You better go now\\n \\n Well, I’d tell you what she wants\\n \\n But I just don’t know how\\n \\n \\n \\n Fifteen jugglers\\n \\n Fifteen jugglers\\n \\n Five believers\\n \\n Five believers\\n \\n All dressed like men\\n \\n Tell yo’ mama not to worry because\\n \\n They’re just my friends\\n \\n \\n \\n Early in the mornin’\\n \\n Early in the mornin’\\n \\n I’m callin’ you to\\n \\n I’m callin’ you to\\n \\n Please come home\\n \\n Yes, I could make it without you\\n \\n If I just did not feel so all alone\\n\\nWell, your railroad gate, you know I just can’t jump it\\n \\n Sometimes it gets so hard, you see\\n \\n I’m just sitting here beating on my trumpet\\n \\n With all these promises you left for me\\n \\n But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I waited for you when I was half sick\\n \\n Yes, I waited for you when you hated me\\n \\n Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic\\n \\n When you knew I had some other place to be\\n \\n Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously\\n \\n But then, now again, not too many can be like you, fortunately\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, six white horses that you did promise\\n \\n Were fin’lly delivered down to the penitentiary\\n \\n But to live outside the law, you must be honest\\n \\n I know you always say that you agree\\n \\n But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I don’t know how it happened\\n \\n But the riverboat captain, he knows my fate\\n \\n But ev’rybody else, even yourself\\n \\n They’re just gonna have to wait\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I got the fever down in my pockets\\n \\n The Persian drunkard, he follows me\\n \\n Yes, I can take him to your house but I can’t unlock it\\n \\n You see, you forgot to leave me with the key\\n \\n Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?\\n \\n \\n \\n Now, I been in jail when all my mail showed\\n \\n That a man can’t give his address out to bad company\\n \\n And now I stand here lookin’ at your yellow railroad\\n \\n In the ruins of your balcony\\n \\n Wond’ring where you are tonight, sweet Marie\\n\\nThe pawnbroker roared\\n\\nAlso, so, so did the landlord\\n\\nThe scene was so crazy, wasn’t it?\\n\\nBoth were so glad\\n\\nTo watch me destroy what I had\\n\\nPain sure brings out the best in people, doesn’t it?\\n\\nWhy didn’t you just leave me if you didn’t want to stay?\\n\\nWhy’d you have to treat me so bad?\\n\\nDid it have to be that way?\\n\\nNow you stand here expectin’ me to remember somethin’ you forgot to say\\n\\nYes, and you, I see you’re still with her, well\\n\\nThat’s fine ’cause she’s comin’ on so strange, can’t you tell?\\n\\nSomebody had better explain\\n\\nShe’s got her iron chain\\n\\nI’d do it, but I, I just can’t remember how\\n\\nYou talk to her\\n\\nShe’s your lover now\\n\\n\\n\\nI already assumed\\n\\nThat we’re in the felony room\\n\\nBut I ain’t a judge, you don’t have to be nice to me\\n\\nBut please tell that\\n\\nTo your friend in the cowboy hat\\n\\nYou know he keeps on sayin’ ev’rythin’ twice to me\\n\\nYou know I was straight with you\\n\\nYou know I’ve never tried to change you in any way\\n\\nYou know if you didn’t want to be with me\\n\\nThat you could . . . didn’t have to stay\\n\\nNow you stand here sayin’ you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?\\n\\nYes, you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays, can’t you reach?\\n\\nI see you kiss her on the cheek ev’rytime she gives a speech\\n\\nWith her picture books of the pyramid\\n\\nAnd her postcards of Billy the Kid (why must everybody bow?)\\n\\nYou better talk to her ’bout it\\n\\nYou’re her lover now\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, ev’rybody that cares\\n\\nIs goin’ up the castle stairs\\n\\nBut I’m not up in your castle, honey\\n\\nIt’s true, I just can’t recall\\n\\nSan Francisco at all\\n\\nI can’t even remember El Paso, uh, honey\\n\\nYou never had to be faithful\\n\\nI didn’t want you to grieve\\n\\nOh, why was it so hard for you\\n\\nIf you didn’t want to be with me, just to leave?\\n\\nNow you stand here while your finger’s goin’ up my sleeve\\n\\nAn’ you, just what do you do anyway? Ain’t there nothin’ you can say?\\n\\nShe’ll be standin’ on the bar soon\\n\\nWith a fish head an’ a harpoon\\n\\nAn’ a fake beard plastered on her brow\\n\\nYou’d better do somethin’ quick\\n\\nShe’s your lover now\\n\\n\\nThe guilty undertaker sighs\\n \\n The lonesome organ grinder cries\\n \\n The silver saxophones say I should refuse you\\n \\n The cracked bells and washed-out horns\\n \\n Blow into my face with scorn\\n \\n But it’s not that way\\n \\n I wasn’t born to lose you\\n \\n \\n \\n I want you, I want you\\n \\n I want you so bad\\n \\n Honey, I want you\\n \\n \\n \\n The drunken politician leaps\\n \\n Upon the street where mothers weep\\n \\n And the saviors who are fast asleep, they wait for you\\n \\n And I wait for them to interrupt\\n \\n Me drinkin’ from my broken cup\\n \\n And ask me to\\n \\n Open up the gate for you\\n \\n \\n \\n I want you, I want you\\n \\n I want you so bad\\n \\n Honey, I want you\\n \\n \\n \\n How all my fathers, they’ve gone down\\n \\n True love they’ve been without it\\n \\n But all their daughters put me down\\n \\n ’Cause I don’t think about it\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I return to the Queen of Spades\\n \\n And talk with my chambermaid\\n \\n She knows that I’m not afraid to look at her\\n \\n She is good to me\\n \\n And there’s nothing she doesn’t see\\n \\n She knows where I’d like to be\\n \\n But it doesn’t matter\\n \\n \\n \\n I want you, I want you\\n \\n I want you so bad\\n \\n Honey, I want you\\n \\n \\n \\n Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit\\n \\n He spoke to me, I took his flute\\n \\n No, I wasn’t very cute to him, was I?\\n \\n But I did it, though, because he lied\\n \\n Because he took you for a ride\\n \\n And because time was on his side\\n \\n And because I . . .\\n \\n \\n \\n I want you, I want you\\n \\n I want you so bad\\n \\n Honey, I want you\\n\\nWith your mercury mouth in the missionary times\\n \\n And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes\\n \\n And your silver cross, and your voice like chimes\\n \\n Oh, who among them do they think could bury you?\\n \\n With your pockets well protected at last\\n \\n And your streetcar visions which you place on the grass\\n \\n And your flesh like silk, and your face like glass\\n \\n Who among them do they think could carry you?\\n \\n Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands\\n \\n Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes\\n \\n My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums\\n \\n Should I leave them by your gate\\n \\n Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?\\n \\n \\n \\n With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace\\n \\n And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace\\n \\n And your basement clothes and your hollow face\\n \\n Who among them can think he could outguess you?\\n \\n With your silhouette when the sunlight dims\\n \\n Into your eyes where the moonlight swims\\n \\n And your matchbook songs and your gypsy hymns\\n \\n Who among them would try to impress you?\\n \\n Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands\\n \\n Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes\\n \\n My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums\\n \\n Should I leave them by your gate\\n \\n Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?\\n \\n \\n \\n The kings of Tyrus with their convict list\\n \\n Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss\\n \\n And you wouldn’t know it would happen like this\\n \\n But who among them really wants just to kiss you?\\n \\n With your childhood flames on your midnight rug\\n \\n And your Spanish manners and your mother’s drugs\\n \\n And your cowboy mouth and your curfew plugs\\n \\n Who among them do you think could resist you?\\n \\n Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands\\n \\n Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes\\n \\n My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums\\n \\n Should I leave them by your gate\\n \\n Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?\\n \\n \\n \\n Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide\\n \\n To show you the dead angels that they used to hide\\n \\n But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?\\n \\n Oh, how could they ever mistake you?\\n \\n They wished you’d accepted the blame for the farm\\n \\n But with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm\\n \\n And with the child of a hoodlum wrapped up in your arms\\n \\n How could they ever, ever persuade you?\\n \\n Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands\\n \\n Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes\\n \\n My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums\\n \\n Should I leave them by your gate\\n \\n Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?\\n \\n \\n \\n With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row\\n \\n And your magazine-husband who one day just had to go\\n \\n And your gentleness now, which you just can’t help but show\\n \\n Who among them do you think would employ you?\\n \\n Now you stand with your thief, you’re on his parole\\n \\n With your holy medallion which your fingertips fold\\n \\n And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul\\n \\n Oh, who among them do you think could destroy you?\\n \\n Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands\\n \\n Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes\\n \\n My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums\\n \\n Should I leave them by your gate\\n \\n Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?\\n\\nStanding on your window, honey\\n \\n Yes, I’ve been here before\\n \\n Feeling so harmless\\n \\n I’m looking at your second door\\n \\n How come you don’t send me no regards?\\n \\n You know I want your lovin’\\n \\n Honey, why are you so hard?\\n \\n \\n \\n Kneeling ’neath your ceiling\\n \\n Yes, I guess I’ll be here for a while\\n \\n I’m tryin’ to read your portrait, but\\n \\n I’m helpless, like a rich man’s child\\n \\n How come you send someone out to have me barred?\\n \\n You know I want your lovin’\\n \\n Honey, why are you so hard?\\n \\n \\n \\n Like a poor fool in his prime\\n \\n Yes, I know you can hear me walk\\n \\n But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime\\n \\n Or is it just solid rock?\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I rush into your hallway\\n \\n Lean against your velvet door\\n \\n I watch upon your scorpion\\n \\n Who crawls across your circus floor\\n \\n Just what do you think you have to guard?\\n \\n You know I want your lovin’\\n \\n Honey, but you’re so hard\\n \\n \\n \\n Achilles is in your alleyway\\n \\n He don’t want me here, he does brag\\n \\n He’s pointing to the sky\\n \\n And he’s hungry, like a man in drag\\n \\n How come you get someone like him to be your guard?\\n \\n You know I want your lovin’\\n \\n Honey, but you’re so hard\\n\\nNobody feels any pain\\n \\n Tonight as I stand inside the rain\\n \\n Ev’rybody knows\\n \\n That Baby’s got new clothes\\n \\n But lately I see her ribbons and her bows\\n \\n Have fallen from her curls\\n \\n She takes just like a woman, yes, she does\\n \\n She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does\\n \\n And she aches just like a woman\\n \\n But she breaks just like a little girl\\n \\n \\n \\n Queen Mary, she’s my friend\\n \\n Yes, I believe I’ll go see her again\\n \\n Nobody has to guess\\n \\n That Baby can’t be blessed\\n \\n Till she sees finally that she’s like all the rest\\n \\n With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls\\n \\n She takes just like a woman, yes, she does\\n \\n She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does\\n \\n And she aches just like a woman\\n \\n But she breaks just like a little girl\\n \\n \\n \\n It was raining from the first\\n \\n And I was dying there of thirst\\n \\n So I came in here\\n \\n And your long-time curse hurts\\n \\n But what’s worse\\n \\n Is this pain in here\\n \\n I can’t stay in here\\n \\n Ain’t it clear that—\\n \\n \\n \\n I just can’t fit\\n \\n Yes, I believe it’s time for us to quit\\n \\n When we meet again\\n \\n Introduced as friends\\n \\n Please don’t let on that you knew me when\\n \\n I was hungry and it was your world\\n \\n Ah, you fake just like a woman, yes, you do\\n \\n You make love just like a woman, yes, you do\\n \\n Then you ache just like a woman\\n \\n But you break just like a little girl\\n\\nYou say you love me\\n \\n And you’re thinkin’ of me\\n \\n But you know you could be wrong\\n \\n You say you told me\\n \\n That you wanna hold me\\n \\n But you know you’re not that strong\\n \\n I just can’t do what I done before\\n \\n I just can’t beg you anymore\\n \\n I’m gonna let you pass\\n \\n And I’ll go last\\n \\n Then time will tell just who fell\\n \\n And who’s been left behind\\n \\n When you go your way and I go mine\\n \\n \\n \\n You say you disturb me\\n \\n And you don’t deserve me\\n \\n But you know sometimes you lie\\n \\n You say you’re shakin’\\n \\n And you’re always achin’\\n \\n But you know how hard you try\\n \\n Sometimes it gets so hard to care\\n \\n It can’t be this way ev’rywhere\\n \\n And I’m gonna let you pass\\n \\n Yes, and I’ll go last\\n \\n Then time will tell just who fell\\n \\n And who’s been left behind\\n \\n When you go your way and I go mine\\n \\n \\n \\n The judge, he holds a grudge\\n \\n He’s gonna call on you\\n \\n But he’s badly built\\n \\n And he walks on stilts\\n \\n Watch out he don’t fall on you\\n \\n \\n \\n You say you’re sorry\\n \\n For tellin’ stories\\n \\n That you know I believe are true\\n \\n You say ya got some\\n \\n Other kinda lover\\n \\n And yes, I believe you do\\n \\n You say my kisses are not like his\\n \\n But this time I’m not gonna tell you why that is\\n \\n I’m just gonna let you pass\\n \\n Yes, and I’ll go last\\n \\n Then time will tell who fell\\n \\n And who’s been left behind\\n \\n When you go your way and I go mine\\n\\nWell, early in the mornin’\\n \\n ’Til late at night\\n \\n I got a poison headache\\n \\n But I feel all right\\n \\n I’m pledging my time to you\\n \\n Hopin’ you’ll come through, too\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, the hobo jumped up\\n \\n He came down natur’lly\\n \\n After he stole my baby\\n \\n Then he wanted to steal me\\n \\n But I’m pledging my time to you\\n \\n Hopin’ you’ll come through, too\\n \\n \\n \\n Won’t you come with me, baby?\\n \\n I’ll take you where you wanna go\\n \\n And if it don’t work out\\n \\n You’ll be the first to know\\n \\n I’m pledging my time to you\\n \\n Hopin’ you’ll come through, too\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, the room is so stuffy\\n \\n I can hardly breathe\\n \\n Ev’rybody’s gone but me and you\\n \\n And I can’t be the last to leave\\n \\n I’m pledging my time to you\\n \\n Hopin’ you’ll come through, too\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, they sent for the ambulance\\n \\n And one was sent\\n \\n Somebody got lucky\\n \\n But it was an accident\\n \\n Now I’m pledging my time to you\\n \\n Hopin’ you’ll come through, too\\n\\nWell, I see you got your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat\\n \\n Yes, I see you got your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat\\n \\n Well, you must tell me, baby\\n \\n How your head feels under somethin’ like that\\n \\n Under your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, you look so pretty in it\\n \\n Honey, can I jump on it sometime?\\n \\n Yes, I just wanna see\\n \\n If it’s really that expensive kind\\n \\n You know it balances on your head\\n \\n Just like a mattress balances\\n \\n On a bottle of wine\\n \\n Your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, if you wanna see the sun rise\\n \\n Honey, I know where\\n \\n We’ll go out and see it sometime\\n \\n We’ll both just sit there and stare\\n \\n Me with my belt\\n \\n Wrapped around my head\\n \\n And you just sittin’ there\\n \\n In your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you\\n \\n It’s bad for your health, he said\\n \\n Yes, I disobeyed his orders\\n \\n I came to see you\\n \\n But I found him there instead\\n \\n You know, I don’t mind him cheatin’ on me\\n \\n But I sure wish he’d take that off his head\\n \\n Your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I see you got a new boyfriend\\n \\n You know, I never seen him before\\n \\n Well, I saw him\\n \\n Makin’ love to you\\n \\n You forgot to close the garage door\\n \\n You might think he loves you for your money\\n \\n But I know what he really loves you for\\n \\n It’s your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat\\n\\nWell, they’ll stone ya when you’re trying to be so good\\n \\n They’ll stone ya just a-like they said they would\\n \\n They’ll stone ya when you’re tryin’ to go home\\n \\n Then they’ll stone ya when you’re there all alone\\n \\n But I would not feel so all alone\\n \\n Everybody must get stoned\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, they’ll stone ya when you’re walkin’ ’long the street\\n \\n They’ll stone ya when you’re tryin’ to keep your seat\\n \\n They’ll stone ya when you’re walkin’ on the floor\\n \\n They’ll stone ya when you’re walkin’ to the door\\n \\n But I would not feel so all alone\\n \\n Everybody must get stoned\\n \\n \\n \\n They’ll stone ya when you’re at the breakfast table\\n \\n They’ll stone ya when you are young and able\\n \\n They’ll stone ya when you’re tryin’ to make a buck\\n \\n They’ll stone ya and then they’ll say, “good luck”\\n \\n Tell ya what, I would not feel so all alone\\n \\n Everybody must get stoned\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, they’ll stone you and say that it’s the end\\n \\n Then they’ll stone you and then they’ll come back again\\n \\n They’ll stone you when you’re riding in your car\\n \\n They’ll stone you when you’re playing your guitar\\n \\n Yes, but I would not feel so all alone\\n \\n Everybody must get stoned\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, they’ll stone you when you walk all alone\\n \\n They’ll stone you when you are walking home\\n \\n They’ll stone you and then say you are brave\\n \\n They’ll stone you when you are set down in your grave\\n \\n But I would not feel so all alone\\n \\n Everybody must get stoned\\n\\nOh, the ragman draws circles\\n \\n Up and down the block\\n \\n I’d ask him what the matter was\\n \\n But I know that he don’t talk\\n \\n And the ladies treat me kindly\\n \\n And furnish me with tape\\n \\n But deep inside my heart\\n \\n I know I can’t escape\\n \\n Oh, Mama, can this really be the end\\n \\n To be stuck inside of Mobile\\n \\n With the Memphis blues again\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, Shakespeare, he’s in the alley\\n \\n With his pointed shoes and his bells\\n \\n Speaking to some French girl\\n \\n Who says she knows me well\\n \\n And I would send a message\\n \\n To find out if she’s talked\\n \\n But the post office has been stolen\\n \\n And the mailbox is locked\\n \\n Oh, Mama, can this really be the end\\n \\n To be stuck inside of Mobile\\n \\n With the Memphis blues again\\n \\n \\n \\n Mona tried to tell me\\n \\n To stay away from the train line\\n \\n She said that all the railroad men\\n \\n Just drink up your blood like wine\\n \\n An’ I said, “Oh, I didn’t know that\\n \\n But then again, there’s only one I’ve met\\n \\n An’ he just smoked my eyelids\\n \\n An’ punched my cigarette”\\n \\n Oh, Mama, can this really be the end\\n \\n To be stuck inside of Mobile\\n \\n With the Memphis blues again\\n \\n \\n \\n Grandpa died last week\\n \\n And now he’s buried in the rocks\\n \\n But everybody still talks about\\n \\n How badly they were shocked\\n \\n But me, I expected it to happen\\n \\n I knew he’d lost control\\n \\n When he built a fire on Main Street\\n \\n And shot it full of holes\\n \\n Oh, Mama, can this really be the end\\n \\n To be stuck inside of Mobile\\n \\n With the Memphis blues again\\n \\n \\n \\n Now the senator came down here\\n \\n Showing ev’ryone his gun\\n \\n Handing out free tickets\\n \\n To the wedding of his son\\n \\n An’ me, I nearly got busted\\n \\n An’ wouldn’t it be my luck\\n \\n To get caught without a ticket\\n \\n And be discovered beneath a truck\\n \\n Oh, Mama, can this really be the end\\n \\n To be stuck inside of Mobile\\n \\n With the Memphis blues again\\n \\n \\n \\n Now the preacher looked so baffled\\n \\n When I asked him why he dressed\\n \\n With twenty pounds of headlines\\n \\n Stapled to his chest\\n \\n But he cursed me when I proved it to him\\n \\n Then I whispered, “Not even you can hide\\n \\n You see, you’re just like me\\n \\n I hope you’re satisfied”\\n \\n Oh, Mama, can this really be the end\\n \\n To be stuck inside of Mobile\\n \\n With the Memphis blues again\\n \\n \\n \\n Now the rainman gave me two cures\\n \\n Then he said, “Jump right in”\\n \\n The one was Texas medicine\\n \\n The other was just railroad gin\\n \\n An’ like a fool I mixed them\\n \\n An’ it strangled up my mind\\n \\n An’ now people just get uglier\\n \\n An’ I have no sense of time\\n \\n Oh, Mama, can this really be the end\\n \\n To be stuck inside of Mobile\\n \\n With the Memphis blues again\\n \\n \\n \\n When Ruthie says come see her\\n \\n In her honky-tonk lagoon\\n \\n Where I can watch her waltz for free\\n \\n ’Neath her Panamanian moon\\n \\n An’ I say, “Aw come on now\\n \\n You must know about my debutante”\\n \\n An’ she says, “Your debutante just knows what you need\\n \\n But I know what you want”\\n \\n Oh, Mama, can this really be the end\\n \\n To be stuck inside of Mobile\\n \\n With the Memphis blues again\\n \\n \\n \\n Now the bricks lay on Grand Street\\n \\n Where the neon madmen climb\\n \\n They all fall there so perfectly\\n \\n It all seems so well timed\\n \\n An’ here I sit so patiently\\n \\n Waiting to find out what price\\n \\n You have to pay to get out of\\n \\n Going through all these things twice\\n \\n Oh, Mama, can this really be the end\\n \\n To be stuck inside of Mobile\\n \\n With the Memphis blues again\\n\\nAin’t it just like the night to play tricks when you’re tryin\\' to be so quiet?\\n \\n We sit here stranded, though we’re all doin’ our best to deny it\\n \\n And Louise holds a handful of rain, temptin’ you to defy it\\n \\n Lights flicker from the opposite loft\\n \\n In this room the heat pipes just cough\\n \\n The country music station plays soft\\n \\n But there’s nothing, really nothing to turn off\\n \\n Just Louise and her lover so entwined\\n \\n And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind\\n \\n \\n \\n In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman’s bluff with the key chain\\n \\n And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the “D” train\\n \\n We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight\\n \\n Ask himself if it’s him or them that’s really insane\\n \\n Louise, she’s all right, she’s just near\\n \\n She’s delicate and seems like the mirror\\n \\n But she just makes it all too concise and too clear\\n \\n That Johanna’s not here\\n \\n The ghost of ’lectricity howls in the bones of her face\\n \\n Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place\\n \\n \\n \\n Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously\\n \\n He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously\\n \\n And when bringing her name up\\n \\n He speaks of a farewell kiss to me\\n \\n He’s sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all\\n \\n Muttering small talk at the wall while I’m in the hall\\n \\n How can I explain?\\n \\n Oh, it’s so hard to get on\\n \\n And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn\\n \\n \\n \\n Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial\\n \\n Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while\\n \\n But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues\\n \\n You can tell by the way she smiles\\n \\n See the primitive wallflower freeze\\n \\n When the jelly-faced women all sneeze\\n \\n Hear the one with the mustache say, “Jeeze\\n \\n I can’t find my knees”\\n \\n Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule\\n \\n But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel\\n \\n \\n \\n The peddler now speaks to the countess who’s pretending to care for him\\n \\n Sayin’, “Name me someone that’s not a parasite and I’ll go out and say a prayer for him”\\n \\n But like Louise always says\\n \\n “Ya can’t look at much, can ya man?”\\n \\n As she, herself, prepares for him\\n \\n And Madonna, she still has not showed\\n \\n We see this empty cage now corrode\\n \\n Where her cape of the stage once had flowed\\n \\n The fiddler, he now steps to the road\\n \\n He writes ev’rything’s been returned which was owed\\n \\n On the back of the fish truck that loads\\n \\n While my conscience explodes\\n \\n The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain\\n \\n And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain\\n\\nYou will search, babe\\n\\nAt any cost\\n\\nBut how long, babe\\n\\nCan you search for what’s not lost?\\n\\nEverybody will help you\\n\\nSome people are very kind\\n\\nBut if I can save you any time\\n\\nCome on, give it to me\\n\\nI’ll keep it with mine\\n\\n\\n\\nI can’t help it\\n\\nIf you might think I’m odd\\n\\nIf I say I’m not loving you for what you are\\n\\nBut for what you’re not\\n\\nEverybody will help you\\n\\nDiscover what you set out to find\\n\\nBut if I can save you any time\\n\\nCome on, give it to me\\n\\nI’ll keep it with mine\\n\\n\\n\\nThe train leaves\\n\\nAt half past ten\\n\\nBut it’ll be back tomorrow\\n\\nSame time again\\n\\nThe conductor he’s weary\\n\\nHe’s still stuck on the line\\n\\nBut if I can save you any time\\n\\nCome on, give it to me\\n\\nI’ll keep it with mine\\n\\nI am a lonesome hobo\\n \\n Without family or friends\\n \\n Where another man’s life might begin\\n \\n That’s exactly where mine ends\\n \\n I have tried my hand at bribery\\n \\n Blackmail and deceit\\n \\n And I’ve served time for ev’rything\\n \\n ’Cept beggin’ on the street\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, once I was rather prosperous\\n \\n There was nothing I did lack\\n \\n I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth\\n \\n And silk upon my back\\n \\n But I did not trust my brother\\n \\n I carried him to blame\\n \\n Which led me to my fatal doom\\n \\n To wander off in shame\\n \\n \\n \\n Kind ladies and kind gentlemen\\n \\n Soon I will be gone\\n \\n But let me just warn you all\\n \\n Before I do pass on\\n \\n Stay free from petty jealousies\\n \\n Live by no man’s code\\n \\n And hold your judgment for yourself\\n \\n Lest you wind up on this road\\n\\nYou got a lotta nerve\\n \\n To say you are my friend\\n \\n When I was down\\n \\n You just stood there grinning\\n \\n \\n \\n You got a lotta nerve\\n \\n To say you got a helping hand to lend\\n \\n You just want to be on\\n \\n The side that’s winning\\n \\n \\n \\n You say I let you down\\n \\n You know it’s not like that\\n \\n If you’re so hurt\\n \\n Why then don’t you show it\\n \\n \\n \\n You say you lost your faith\\n \\n But that’s not where it’s at\\n \\n You had no faith to lose\\n \\n And you know it\\n \\n \\n \\n I know the reason\\n \\n That you talk behind my back\\n \\n I used to be among the crowd\\n \\n You’re in with\\n \\n \\n \\n Do you take me for such a fool\\n \\n To think I’d make contact\\n \\n With the one who tries to hide\\n \\n What he don’t know to begin with\\n \\n \\n \\n You see me on the street\\n \\n You always act surprised\\n \\n You say, “How are you?” “Good luck”\\n \\n But you don’t mean it\\n \\n \\n \\n When you know as well as me\\n \\n You’d rather see me paralyzed\\n \\n Why don’t you just come out once\\n \\n And scream it\\n \\n \\n \\n No, I do not feel that good\\n \\n When I see the heartbreaks you embrace\\n \\n If I was a master thief\\n \\n Perhaps I’d rob them\\n \\n \\n \\n And now I know you’re dissatisfied\\n \\n With your position and your place\\n \\n Don’t you understand\\n \\n It’s not my problem\\n \\n \\n \\n I wish that for just one time\\n \\n You could stand inside my shoes\\n \\n And just for that one moment\\n \\n I could be you\\n \\n \\n \\n Yes, I wish that for just one time\\n \\n You could stand inside my shoes\\n \\n You’d know what a drag it is\\n \\n To see you\\n\\n“Oh, help me in my weakness”\\n \\n I heard the drifter say\\n \\n As they carried him from the courtroom\\n \\n And were taking him away\\n \\n “My trip hasn’t been a pleasant one\\n \\n And my time it isn’t long\\n \\n And I still do not know\\n \\n What it was that I’ve done wrong”\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside\\n \\n A tear came to his eye\\n \\n “You fail to understand,” he said\\n \\n “Why must you even try?”\\n \\n Outside, the crowd was stirring\\n \\n You could hear it from the door\\n \\n Inside, the judge was stepping down\\n \\n While the jury cried for more\\n \\n \\n \\n “Oh, stop that cursed jury”\\n \\n Cried the attendant and the nurse\\n \\n “The trial was bad enough\\n \\n But this is ten times worse”\\n \\n Just then a bolt of lightning\\n \\n Struck the courthouse out of shape\\n \\n And while ev’rybody knelt to pray\\n \\n The drifter did escape\\n\\nDear landlord\\n \\n Please don’t put a price on my soul\\n \\n My burden is heavy\\n \\n My dreams are beyond control\\n \\n When that steamboat whistle blows\\n \\n I’m gonna give you all I got to give\\n \\n And I do hope you receive it well\\n \\n Dependin’ on the way you feel that you live\\n \\n \\n \\n Dear landlord\\n \\n Please heed these words that I speak\\n \\n I know you’ve suffered much\\n \\n But in this you are not so unique\\n \\n All of us, at times, we might work too hard\\n \\n To have it too fast and too much\\n \\n And anyone can fill his life up\\n \\n With things he can see but he just cannot touch\\n \\n \\n \\n Dear landlord\\n \\n Please don’t dismiss my case\\n \\n I’m not about to argue\\n \\n I’m not about to move to no other place\\n \\n Now, each of us has his own special gift\\n \\n And you know this was meant to be true\\n \\n And if you don’t underestimate me\\n \\n I won’t underestimate you\\n\\n“There must be some way out of here,” said the joker to the thief\\n \\n “There’s too much confusion, I can’t get no relief\\n \\n Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth\\n \\n None of them along the line know what any of it is worth”\\n \\n \\n \\n “No reason to get excited,” the thief, he kindly spoke\\n \\n “There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke\\n \\n But you and I, we’ve been through that, and this is not our fate\\n \\n So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late”\\n \\n \\n \\n All along the watchtower, princes kept the view\\n \\n While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too\\n \\n \\n \\n Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl\\n \\n Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl\\n\\nAs I went out one morning\\n \\n To breathe the air around Tom Paine’s\\n \\n I spied the fairest damsel\\n \\n That ever did walk in chains\\n \\n I offer’d her my hand\\n \\n She took me by the arm\\n \\n I knew that very instant\\n \\n She meant to do me harm\\n \\n \\n \\n “Depart from me this moment”\\n \\n I told her with my voice\\n \\n Said she, “But I don’t wish to”\\n \\n Said I, “But you have no choice”\\n \\n “I beg you, sir,” she pleaded\\n \\n From the corners of her mouth\\n \\n “I will secretly accept you\\n \\n And together we’ll fly south”\\n \\n \\n \\n Just then Tom Paine, himself\\n \\n Came running from across the field\\n \\n Shouting at this lovely girl\\n \\n And commanding her to yield\\n \\n And as she was letting go her grip\\n \\n Up Tom Paine did run,\\n \\n “I’m sorry, sir,” he said to me\\n \\n “I’m sorry for what she’s done”\\n\\nJohn Wesley Harding\\n \\n Was a friend to the poor\\n \\n He trav’led with a gun in ev’ry hand\\n \\n All along this countryside\\n \\n He opened many a door\\n \\n But he was never known\\n \\n To hurt an honest man\\n \\n \\n \\n ’Twas down in Chaynee County\\n \\n A time they talk about\\n \\n With his lady by his side\\n \\n He took a stand\\n \\n And soon the situation there\\n \\n Was all but straightened out\\n \\n For he was always known\\n \\n To lend a helping hand\\n \\n \\n \\n All across the telegraph\\n \\n His name it did resound\\n \\n But no charge held against him\\n \\n Could they prove\\n \\n And there was no man around\\n \\n Who could track or chain him down\\n \\n He was never known\\n \\n To make a foolish move\\n\\nThere was a wicked messenger\\n \\n From Eli he did come\\n \\n With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter\\n \\n When questioned who had sent for him\\n \\n He answered with his thumb\\n \\n For his tongue it could not speak, but only flatter\\n \\n \\n \\n He stayed behind the assembly hall\\n \\n It was there he made his bed\\n \\n Oftentimes he could be seen returning\\n \\n Until one day he just appeared\\n \\n With a note in his hand which read\\n \\n “The soles of my feet, I swear they’re burning”\\n \\n \\n \\n Oh, the leaves began to fallin’\\n \\n And the seas began to part\\n \\n And the people that confronted him were many\\n \\n And he was told but these few words\\n \\n Which opened up his heart\\n \\n “If ye cannot bring good news, then don’t bring any”\\n\\nDown along the cove\\n \\n I spied my true love comin’ my way\\n \\n Down along the cove\\n \\n I spied my true love comin’ my way\\n \\n I say, “Lord, have mercy, mama\\n \\n It

of solid gold\\n \\n Searching for the very souls\\n \\n Whom already have been sold\\n \\n \\n \\n “Arise, arise,” he cried so loud\\n \\n In a voice without restraint\\n \\n “Come out, ye gifted kings and queens\\n \\n And hear my sad complaint\\n \\n No martyr is among ye now\\n \\n Whom you can call your own\\n \\n So go on your way accordingly\\n \\n But know you’re not alone”\\n \\n \\n \\n I dreamed I saw St. Augustine\\n \\n Alive with fiery breath\\n \\n And I dreamed I was amongst the ones\\n \\n That put him out to death\\n \\n Oh, I awoke in anger\\n \\n So alone and terrified\\n \\n I put my fingers against the glass\\n \\n And bowed my head and cried\\n\\nWell, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest\\n \\n They were the best of friends\\n \\n So when Frankie Lee needed money one day\\n \\n Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens\\n \\n And placed them on a footstool\\n \\n Just above the plotted plain\\n \\n Sayin’, “Take your pick, Frankie Boy\\n \\n My loss will be your gain”\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down\\n \\n And put his fingers to his chin\\n \\n But with the cold eyes of Judas on him\\n \\n His head began to spin\\n \\n “Would ya please not stare at me like that,” he said\\n \\n “It’s just my foolish pride\\n \\n But sometimes a man must be alone\\n \\n And this is no place to hide”\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, Judas, he just winked and said\\n \\n “All right, I’ll leave you here\\n \\n But you’d better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want\\n \\n Before they all disappear”\\n \\n “I’m gonna start my pickin’ right now\\n \\n Just tell me where you’ll be”\\n \\n Judas pointed down the road\\n \\n And said, “Eternity!”\\n \\n \\n \\n “Eternity?” said Frankie Lee\\n \\n With a voice as cold as ice\\n \\n “That’s right,” said Judas Priest, “Eternity\\n \\n Though you might call it ‘Paradise’”\\n \\n “I don’t call it anything”\\n \\n Said Frankie Lee with a smile\\n \\n “All right,” said Judas Priest\\n \\n “I’ll see you after a while”\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down\\n \\n Feelin’ low and mean\\n \\n When just then a passing stranger\\n \\n Burst upon the scene\\n \\n Saying, “Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler\\n \\n Whose father is deceased?\\n \\n Well, if you are, there’s a fellow callin’ you down the road\\n \\n And they say his name is Priest”\\n \\n \\n \\n “Oh, yes, he is my friend”\\n \\n Said Frankie Lee in fright\\n \\n “I do recall him very well\\n \\n In fact, he just left my sight”\\n \\n “Yes, that’s the one,” said the stranger\\n \\n As quiet as a mouse\\n \\n “Well, my message is, he’s down the road\\n \\n Stranded in a house”\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked\\n \\n He dropped ev’rything and ran\\n \\n Until he came up to the spot\\n \\n Where Judas Priest did stand\\n \\n “What kind of house is this,” he said\\n \\n “Where I have come to roam?”\\n \\n “It’s not a house,” said Judas Priest\\n \\n “It’s not a house . . . it’s a home”\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled\\n \\n He soon lost all control\\n \\n Over ev’rything which he had made\\n \\n While the mission bells did toll\\n \\n He just stood there staring\\n \\n At that big house as bright as any sun\\n \\n With four and twenty windows\\n \\n And a woman’s face in ev’ry one\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee\\n \\n With a soulful, bounding leap\\n \\n And, foaming at the mouth\\n \\n He began to make his midnight creep\\n \\n For sixteen nights and days he raved\\n \\n But on the seventeenth he burst\\n \\n Into the arms of Judas Priest\\n \\n Which is where he died of thirst\\n \\n \\n \\n No one tried to say a thing\\n \\n When they took him out in jest\\n \\n Except, of course, the little neighbor boy\\n \\n Who carried him to rest\\n \\n And he just walked along, alone\\n \\n With his guilt so well concealed\\n \\n And muttered underneath his breath\\n \\n “Nothing is revealed”\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, the moral of the story\\n \\n The moral of this song\\n \\n Is simply that one should never be\\n \\n Where one does not belong\\n \\n So when you see your neighbor carryin’ somethin’\\n \\n Help him with his load\\n \\n And don’t go mistaking Paradise\\n \\n For that home across the road\\n\\nI pity the poor immigrant\\n \\n Who wishes he would’ve stayed home\\n \\n Who uses all his power to do evil\\n \\n But in the end is always left so alone\\n \\n That man whom with his fingers cheats\\n \\n And who lies with ev’ry breath\\n \\n Who passionately hates his life\\n \\n And likewise, fears his death\\n \\n \\n \\n I pity the poor immigrant\\n \\n Whose strength is spent in vain\\n \\n Whose heaven is like Ironsides\\n \\n Whose tears are like rain\\n \\n Who eats but is not satisfied\\n \\n Who hears but does not see\\n \\n Who falls in love with wealth itself\\n \\n And turns his back on me\\n \\n \\n \\n I pity the poor immigrant\\n \\n Who tramples through the mud\\n \\n Who fills his mouth with laughing\\n \\n And who builds his town with blood\\n \\n Whose visions in the final end\\n \\n Must shatter like the glass\\n \\n I pity the poor immigrant\\n \\n When his gladness comes to pass\\n\\nI have heard rumors all over town\\n \\n They say that you’re planning to put me down\\n \\n All I would like you to do\\n \\n Is tell me that it isn’t true\\n \\n \\n \\n They say that

some Tularosa alley\\n\\nMaybe in La Rio Pecas valley\\n\\nBilly, you\\'re so far away from home\\n\\nBilly, you\\'re so far away from home\\n\\nThere’s nothing ’round here I believe in\\n\\n’Cept you, yeah you\\n\\nAnd there’s nothing to me that’s sacred\\n\\n’Cept you, yeah you\\n\\n\\n\\nYou’re the one that reaches me\\n\\nYou’re the one that I admire\\n\\nEvery time we meet together\\n\\nMy soul feels like it’s on fire\\n\\nNothing matters to me\\n\\nAnd there’s nothing I desire\\n\\n’Cept you, yeah you\\n\\n\\n\\nNothing ’round here I care to try for\\n\\n’Cept you, yeah you\\n\\nGot nothing left to live or die for\\n\\n’Cept you, yeah you\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s a hymn I used to hear\\n\\nIn the churches all the time\\n\\nMake me feel so good inside\\n\\nSo peaceful, so sublime\\n\\nAnd there’s nothing to remind me of that\\n\\nOld familiar chime\\n\\n’Cept you, uh huh you\\n\\n\\n\\nUsed to play in the cemetery\\n\\nDance and sing and run when I was a child\\n\\nNever seemed strange\\n\\nBut now I just pass mournfully by\\n\\nThat place where the bones of life are piled\\n\\nI know somethin’ has changed\\n\\nI’m a stranger here and no one sees me\\n\\n’Cept you, yeah you\\n\\n\\n\\nNothing much matters or seems to please me\\n\\n’Cept you, yeah you\\n\\nNothing hypnotizes me\\n\\nOr holds me in a spell\\n\\nEverything runs by me\\n\\nJust like water from a well\\n\\nEverybody wants my attention\\n\\nEverybody’s got something to sell\\n\\n’Cept you, yeah you\\n\\n\\nWell, I walked all night long\\n\\nListenin’ to them church bells tone\\n\\nYes, I walked all night long\\n\\nListenin’ to them church bells tone\\n\\nEither someone needing mercy\\n\\nOr maybe something I’ve done wrong\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, your friends come by for you\\n\\nI don’t know what to say\\n\\nWell, your friends come by for you\\n\\nI don’t know what to say\\n\\nI just can’t face up to tell ’em\\n\\nHoney you just went away\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, children cry for mother\\n\\nI tell them, “Mother took a trip”\\n\\nWell, children cry for mother\\n\\nI tell them, “Mother took a trip”\\n\\nWell, I walk on pins and needles\\n\\nI hope my tongue don’t slip\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I gaze at passing strangers\\n\\nIn case I might see you\\n\\nYes, I gaze at passing strangers\\n\\nIn case I might see you\\n\\nBut the sun goes around the heavens\\n\\nAnd another day just drives on through\\n\\nMama, take this badge off of me\\n\\nI can’t use it anymore\\n\\nIt’s gettin’ dark, too dark for me to see\\n\\nI feel like I’m knockin’ on heaven’s door\\n\\n\\n\\nKnock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door\\n\\nKnock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door\\n\\nKnock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door\\n\\nKnock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door\\n\\n\\n\\nMama, put my guns in the ground\\n\\nI can’t shoot them anymore\\n\\nThat long black cloud is comin’ down\\n\\nI feel like I’m knockin’ on heaven’s door\\n\\n\\n\\nKnock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door\\n\\nKnock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door\\n\\nKnock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door\\n\\nKnock, knock, knockin’ on heaven’s door\\n\\nThere’s guns across the river aimin’ at ya\\n\\nLawman on your trail, he’d like to catch ya\\n\\nBounty hunters, too, they’d like to get ya\\n\\nBilly, they don’t like you to be so free\\n\\n\\n\\nCampin’ out all night on the berenda\\n\\nDealin’ cards ’til dawn in the hacienda\\n\\nUp to Boot Hill they’d like to send ya\\n\\nBilly, don’t you turn your back on me\\n\\n\\n\\nPlayin’ around with some sweet señorita\\n\\nInto her dark hallway she will lead ya\\n\\nIn some lonesome shadows she will greet ya\\n\\nBilly, you’re so far away from home\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s eyes behind the mirrors in empty places\\n\\nBullet holes and scars between the spaces\\n\\nThere’s always one more notch and ten more paces\\n\\nBilly, and you’re walkin’ all alone\\n\\n\\n\\nThey say that Pat Garrett’s got your number\\n\\nSo sleep with one eye open when you slumber\\n\\nEvery little sound just might be thunder\\n\\nThunder from the barrel of his gun\\n\\n\\n\\nGuitars will play your grand finale\\n\\nDown in some Tularosa alley\\n\\nMaybe in the Rio Pecos valley\\n\\nBilly, you’re so far away from home\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s always some new stranger sneakin’ glances\\n\\nSome trigger-happy fool willin’ to take chances\\n\\nAnd some old whore from San Pedro to make advances\\n\\nAdvances on your spirit and your soul\\n\\n\\n\\nThe businessmen from Taos want you to go down\\n\\nThey’ve hired Pat Garrett to force a showdown\\n\\nBilly, don’t it make ya feel so low-down\\n\\nTo be shot down by the man who was your friend?\\n\\n\\n\\nHang on to your woman if you got one\\n\\nRemember in El Paso, once, you shot one\\n\\nShe may have been a whore, but she was a hot one\\n\\nBilly, you been runnin’ for so long\\n\\n\\n\\nGuitars will play your grand finale\\n\\nDown in some Tularosa alley\\n\\nMaybe in the Rio Pecos valley\\n\\nBilly, you’re so far away from home\\n\\nMay God bless and keep you always\\n\\nMay your wishes all come true\\n\\nMay you always do for others\\n\\nAnd let others do for you\\n\\nMay you build a ladder to the stars\\n\\nAnd climb on every rung\\n\\nMay you stay forever young\\n\\nForever young, forever young\\n\\nMay you stay forever young\\n\\n\\n\\nMay you grow up to be righteous\\n\\nMay you grow up to be true\\n\\nMay you always know the truth\\n\\nAnd see the lights surrounding you\\n\\nMay you always be courageous\\n\\nStand upright and be strong\\n\\nMay you stay forever young\\n\\nForever young, forever young\\n\\nMay you stay forever young\\n\\n\\n\\nMay your hands always be busy\\n\\nMay your feet always be swift\\n\\nMay you have a strong foundation\\n\\nWhen the winds of changes shift\\n\\nMay your heart always be joyful\\n\\nMay your song always be sung\\n\\nMay you stay forever young\\n\\nForever young, forever young\\n\\nMay you stay forever young\\n\\nTough Mama, meat shakin’ on your bones\\n\\nI\\'m gonna go down to the river and get some stones\\n\\nSister\\'s on the highway with that steel-drivin\\' crew\\n\\nPapa\\'s in the big house, his workin\\' days are through\\n\\nTough Mama, \\x0bcan I blow a little smoke on you?\\n\\n\\n\\nDark Lady, Won\\'t you move it on over and make some room?\\n\\nRollin’ steady, sweepin’ through the country like a broom\\n\\nPut your arms around me, like a circle ‘round the sun\\n\\nYou got a pocket full of money but you can’t help me none\\n\\nShady Lady, the Dress that you are wearin’ weighs a ton\\n\\n\\n\\nAngel Baby, born of a blinding light and a changing wind\\n\\nDrive me crazy, you know who you are and where you’ve been\\n\\nStarin’ at the ceiling, standin’ on the chair\\n\\nBig fires blazing, ashes in the air\\n\\nAngel Baby, I wonder what you done back there\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m crestfallen—the world of illusion is at my door\\n\\nI hear you callin’, same old thing like it was before\\n\\nCrawlin’ through the meadow like a lion in the den\\n\\nHeadin’ for the round-up at the rainbow’s end\\n\\nTough Mama, let’s get on the road again\\n\\nI hate myself for lovin’ you and the weakness that it showed\\n\\nYou were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road\\n\\nThe stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel\\n\\nI hate myself for lovin’ you and I’m glad the curtain fell\\n\\n\\n\\nI hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed\\n\\nAnd the mercy that you showed to me, who ever would have guessed?\\n\\nI went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within\\n\\nThat hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin\\n\\n\\n\\nHeard your songs of freedom and man forever stripped\\n\\nActing out his folly while his back is being whipped\\n\\nLike a slave in orbit, he’s beaten ’til he’s tame\\n\\nAll for a moment’s glory and it’s a dirty, rotten shame\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are those who worship loneliness, I’m not one of them\\n\\nIn this age of fiberglass I’m searching for a gem\\n\\nThe crystal ball up on the wall hasn’t shown me nothing yet\\n\\nI’ve paid the price of solitude, but at last I’m out of debt\\n\\n\\n\\nCan’t recall a useful thing you ever did for me\\n\\n’Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knees\\n\\nWe stared into each other’s eyes ’til one of us would break\\n\\nNo use to apologize, what diff’rence would it make?\\n\\n\\n\\nSo sing your praise of progress and of the Doom Machine\\n\\nThe naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen\\n\\nLady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I’m at\\n\\nI hate myself for lovin’ you, but I should get over that\\n\\nSomething there is about you that strikes a match in me\\n\\nIs it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?\\n\\nOr is it because you remind me of something that used to be\\n\\nSomethin’ that crossed over from another century?\\n\\n\\n\\nThought I’d shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth\\n\\nRainy days on the Great Lakes, walkin’ the hills of old Duluth\\n\\nThere was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black night and then there was Ruth\\n\\nSomething there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth\\n\\n\\n\\nSuddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings\\n\\nDon’t have to look no further, you’re the soul of many things\\n\\nI could say that I’d be faithful, I could say it in one sweet, easy breath\\n\\nBut to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death\\n\\n\\n\\nSomething there is about you that moves with style and grace\\n\\nI was in a whirlwind, now I’m in some better place\\n\\nMy hand’s on the sabre and you’ve picked up the baton\\n\\nSomethin’ there is about you that I can’t quite put my finger on\\n\\nHazel, dirty-blonde hair\\n\\nI wouldn’t be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere\\n\\nYou got something I want plenty of\\n\\nOoh, a little touch of your love\\n\\n\\n\\nHazel, stardust in your eye\\n\\nYou’re goin’ somewhere and so am I\\n\\nI’d give you the sky high above\\n\\nOoh, for a little touch of your love\\n\\n\\n\\nOh no, I don’t need any reminder\\n\\nTo know how much I really care\\n\\nBut it’s just making me blinder and blinder\\n\\nBecause I’m up on a hill and still you’re not there\\n\\n\\n\\nHazel, you called and I came\\n\\nNow don’t make me play this waiting game\\n\\nYou’ve got something I want plenty of\\n\\nOoh, a little touch of your love\\n\\nI love you more than ever, more than time and more than love\\n\\nI love you more than money and more than the stars above\\n\\nLove you more than madness, more than waves upon the sea\\n\\nLove you more than life itself, you mean that much to me\\n\\n\\n\\nEver since you walked right in, the circle’s been complete\\n\\nI’ve said goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street\\n\\nTo the courtyard of the jester which is hidden from the sun\\n\\nI love you more than ever and I haven’t yet begun\\n\\n\\n\\nYou breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live\\n\\nWhen I was deep in poverty you taught me how to give\\n\\nDried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole\\n\\nQuenched my thirst and satisfied the burning in my soul\\n\\n\\n\\nYou gave me babies one, two, three, what is more, you saved my life\\n\\nEye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife\\n\\nMy thoughts of you don’t ever rest, they’d kill me if I lie\\n\\nI’d sacrifice the world for you and watch my senses die\\n\\n\\n\\nThe tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth\\n\\nWe’ll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth\\n\\nWhat’s lost is lost, we can’t regain what went down in the flood\\n\\nBut happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s never been my duty to remake the world at large\\n\\nNor is it my intention to sound a battle charge\\n\\n’Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn’t bend\\n\\nAnd if there is eternity I’d love you there again\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, can’t you see that you were born to stand by my side\\n\\nAnd I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride\\n\\nYou’re the other half of what I am, you’re the missing piece\\n\\nAnd I love you more than ever with that love that doesn’t cease\\n\\n\\n\\nYou turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see\\n\\nJust bein’ next to you is a natural thing for me\\n\\nAnd I could never let you go, no matter what goes on\\n\\n‘Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone\\n\\nI’ve just reached a place\\n\\nWhere the willow don’t bend\\n\\nThere’s not much more to be said\\n\\nIt’s the top of the end\\n\\nI’m going\\n\\nI’m going\\n\\nI’m gone\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m closin’ the book\\n\\nOn the pages and the text\\n\\nAnd I don’t really care\\n\\nWhat happens next\\n\\nI’m just going\\n\\nI’m going\\n\\nI’m gone\\n\\n\\n\\nI been hangin’ on threads\\n\\nI been playin’ it straight\\n\\nNow, I’ve just got to cut loose\\n\\nBefore it gets late\\n\\nSo I’m going\\n\\nI’m going\\n\\nI’m gone\\n\\n\\n\\nGrandma said, “Boy, go and follow your heart\\n\\nAnd you’ll be fine at the end of the line\\n\\nAll that’s gold isn’t meant to shine\\n\\nDon’t you and your one true love ever part”\\n\\n\\n\\nI been walkin’ the road\\n\\nI been livin’ on the edge\\n\\nNow, I’ve just got to go\\n\\nBefore I get to the ledge\\n\\nSo I’m going\\n\\nI’m just going\\n\\nI’m gone\\n\\nOn a night like this\\n\\nSo glad you came around\\n\\nHold on to me so tight\\n\\nAnd heat up some coffee grounds\\n\\nWe got much to talk about\\n\\nAnd much to reminisce\\n\\nIt sure is right\\n\\nOn a night like this\\n\\n\\n\\nOn a night like this\\n\\nSo glad you’ve come to stay\\n\\nHold on to me, pretty miss\\n\\nSay you’ll never go away to stray\\n\\nRun your fingers down my spine\\n\\nBring me a touch of bliss\\n\\nIt sure feels right\\n\\nOn a night like this\\n\\n\\n\\nOn a night like this\\n\\nI can’t get any sleep\\n\\nThe air is so cold outside\\n\\nAnd the snow’s so deep\\n\\nBuild a fire, throw on logs\\n\\nAnd listen to it hiss\\n\\nAnd let it burn, burn, burn, burn\\n\\nOn a night like this\\n\\n\\n\\nPut your body next to mine\\n\\nAnd keep me company\\n\\nThere is plenty a-room for all\\n\\nSo please don’t elbow me\\n\\n\\n\\nLet the four winds blow\\n\\nAround this old cabin door\\n\\nIf I’m not too far off\\n\\nI think we did this once before\\n\\nThere’s more frost on the window glass\\n\\nWith each new tender kiss\\n\\nBut it sure feels right\\n\\nOn a night like this\\n\\nTwilight on the frozen lake\\n\\nNorth wind about to break\\n\\nOn footprints in the snow\\n\\nSilence down below\\n\\n\\n\\nYou’re beautiful beyond words\\n\\nYou’re beautiful to me\\n\\nYou can make me cry\\n\\nNever say goodbye\\n\\n\\n\\nTime is all I have to give\\n\\nYou can have it if you choose\\n\\nWith me you can live\\n\\nNever say goodbye\\n\\n\\n\\nMy dreams are made of iron and steel\\n\\nWith a big bouquet\\n\\nOf roses hanging down\\n\\nFrom the heavens to the ground\\n\\n\\n\\nThe crashing waves roll over me\\n\\nAs I stand upon the sand\\n\\nWait for you to come\\n\\nAnd grab hold of my hand\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, baby, baby, baby blue\\n\\nYou’ll change your last name, too\\n\\nYou’ve turned your hair to brown\\n\\nLove to see it hangin’ down\\n\\nYou angel you\\n\\nYou got me under your wing\\n\\nThe way you walk and the way you talk\\n\\nI feel I could almost sing\\n\\n\\n\\nYou angel you\\n\\nYou’re as fine as anything’s fine\\n\\nThe way you walk and the way you talk\\n\\nIt sure plays on my mind\\n\\n\\n\\nYou know I can’t sleep at night for trying\\n\\nNever did feel this way before\\n\\nI get up at night and walk the floor\\n\\nIf this is love then gimme more\\n\\nAnd more and more and more and more\\n\\n\\n\\nYou angel you\\n\\nYou’re as fine as can be\\n\\nThe way you smile like a sweet baby child\\n\\nIt just falls all over me\\n\\n\\n\\nYou know I can’t sleep at night for trying\\n\\nNever did feel this way before\\n\\nNever did get up and walk the floor\\n\\nIf this is love then gimme more\\n\\nAnd more and more and more\\n\\n\\n\\nYou angel you\\n\\nYou got me under your wing\\n\\nThe way you walk and the way you talk\\n\\nIt says everything\\n\\nThey sat together in the park\\n\\nAs the evening sky grew dark\\n\\nShe looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones\\n\\n’Twas then he felt alone and wished that he’d gone straight\\n\\nAnd watched out for a simple twist of fate\\n\\n\\n\\nThey walked along by the old canal\\n\\nA little confused, I remember well\\n\\nAnd stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burnin’ bright\\n\\nHe felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train\\n\\nMoving with a simple twist of fate\\n\\n\\n\\nA saxophone someplace far off played\\n\\nAs she was walkin’ by the arcade\\n\\nAs the light bust through a beat-up shade where he was wakin’ up,\\n\\nShe dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate\\n\\nAnd forgot about a simple twist of fate\\n\\n\\n\\nHe woke up, the room was bare\\n\\nHe didn’t see her anywhere\\n\\nHe told himself he didn’t care, pushed the window open wide\\n\\nFelt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate\\n\\nBrought on by a simple twist of fate\\n\\n\\n\\nHe hears the ticking of the clocks\\n\\nAnd walks along with a parrot that talks\\n\\nHunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in\\n\\nMaybe she’ll pick him out again, how long must he wait\\n\\nOnce more for a simple twist of fate\\n\\n\\n\\nPeople tell me it’s a sin\\n\\nTo know and feel too much within\\n\\nI still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring\\n\\nShe was born in spring, but I was born too late\\n\\nBlame it on a simple twist of fate\\n\\nI can see the turning of the key\\nI\\'ve been deceived by the clown inside of me\\nI thought that he was righteous but he\\'s vain\\nOh, something\\'s a-telling me I wear the ball and chain\\nMy patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost\\nHe\\'s always off somewhere when I need him most\\nThe Spanish moon is rising on the hill\\nBut my heart is a-tellin\\' me I love you still\\nI come back to the town from the flaming moon\\nI see you in the streets, I begin to swoon\\nI love to see you dress before the mirror\\nWon\\'t you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?\\nEverybody\\'s wearing a disguise\\nTo hide what they\\'ve got left behind their eyes\\nBut me, I can\\'t cover what I am\\nWherever the children go I\\'ll follow them\\nI march in the parade of liberty\\nBut as long as I love you I\\'m not free\\nHow long must I suffer such abuse?\\nWon\\'t you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?\\nI\\'ve given up the game, I\\'ve got to leave\\nThe pot of gold is only make-believe\\nThe treasure can\\'t be found by men who search\\nWhose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church\\nWe sat in an empty theater and we kissed\\nI asked ya please to cross me off your list\\nMy head tells me it\\'s time to make a change\\nBut my heart is telling me I love ya but you\\'re strange\\nSo one more time at midnight, near the wall\\nTake off your heavy make-up and your shawl\\nWon\\'t you descend from the throne, from where you sit?\\nLet me feel your love one more time before I abandon it\\n\\nEverything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing\\n\\nDeath kept followin’, trackin’ us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing\\n\\nNow somebody’s got to show their hand, time is an enemy\\n\\nI know you’re long gone, I guess it must be up to me\\n\\n\\n\\nIf I’d thought about it I never would’ve done it, I guess I would’ve let it slide\\n\\nIf I’d lived my life by what others were thinkin’, the heart inside me would’ve died\\n\\nI was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity\\n\\nSomeone had to reach for the risin’ star, I guess it was up to me\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, the Union Central is pullin’ out and the orchids are in bloom\\n\\nI’ve only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume\\n\\nIn fourteen months I’ve only smiled once and I didn’t do it consciously\\n\\nSomebody’s got to find your trail, I guess it must be up to me\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch\\n\\nI’d just about convinced myself that nothin’ had changed that much\\n\\nThe old Rounder in the iron mask slipped me the master key\\n\\nSomebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers’ club\\n\\nI would’ve followed you in the door but I didn’t have a ticket stub\\n\\nSo I waited all night ’til the break of day, hopin’ one of us could get free\\n\\nWhen the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, the only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk\\n\\nWas to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work\\n\\nWas I a fool or not to try to protect your identity?\\n\\nYou looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I met somebody face to face and I had to remove my hat\\n\\nShe’s everything I need and love but I can’t be swayed by that\\n\\nIt frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be\\n\\nBut she ain’t a-gonna make me move, I guess it must be up to me\\n\\n\\n\\nWe heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex\\n\\nIt didn’t amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects\\n\\nWhen you bite off more than you can chew you pay the penalty\\n\\nSomebody’s got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, Dupree came in pimpin’ tonight to the Thunderbird Café\\n\\nCrystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way\\n\\nWell, I just can’t rest without you, love, I need your company\\n\\nBut you ain’t a-gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle\\n\\nShe’s the one you been wond’rin’ about, but there’s really nothin’ much to tell\\n\\nWe both heard voices for a while, now the rest is history\\n\\nSomebody’s got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me\\n\\n\\n\\nSo go on, boys, and play your hands, life is a pantomime\\n\\nThe ringleaders from the county seat say you don’t have all that much time\\n\\nAnd the girl with me behind the shades, she ain’t my property\\n\\nOne of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd if we never meet again, baby, remember me\\n\\nHow my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody\\n\\nAnd the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you, free\\n\\nNo one else could play that tune, you know it was up to m\\n\\nOur conversation was short and sweet\\n\\nIt nearly swept me off-a my feet\\n\\nAnd I’m back in the rain, oh, oh\\n\\nAnd you are on dry land\\n\\nYou made it there somehow\\n\\nYou’re a big girl now\\n\\n\\n\\nBird on the horizon, sittin’ on a fence\\n\\nHe’s singin’ his song for me at his own expense\\n\\nAnd I’m just like that bird, oh, oh\\n\\nSingin’ just for you\\n\\nI hope that you can hear\\n\\nHear me singin’ through these tears\\n\\n\\n\\nTime is a jet plane, it moves too fast\\n\\nOh, but what a shame if all we’ve shared can’t last\\n\\nI can change, I swear, oh, oh\\n\\nSee what you can do\\n\\nI can make it through\\n\\nYou can make it too\\n\\n\\n\\nLove is so simple, to quote a phrase\\n\\nYou’ve known it all the time, I’m learnin’ it these days\\n\\nOh, I know where I can find you, oh, oh\\n\\nIn somebody’s room\\n\\nIt’s a price I have to pay\\n\\nYou’re a big girl all the way\\n\\n\\n\\nA change in the weather is known to be extreme\\n\\nBut what’s the sense of changing horses in midstream?\\n\\nI’m going out of my mind, oh, oh\\n\\nWith a pain that stops and starts\\n\\nLike a corkscrew to my heart\\n\\nEver since we’ve been apart\\n\\nLazy stadium night\\n\\nCatfish on the mound\\n\\n“Strike three,” the umpire said\\n\\nBatter have to go back and sit down\\n\\n\\n\\nCatfish, million-dollar-man\\n\\nNobody can throw the ball like Catfish can\\n\\n\\n\\nUsed to work on Mr. Finley’s farm\\n\\nBut the old man wouldn’t pay\\n\\nSo he packed his glove and took his arm\\n\\nAn’ one day he just ran away\\n\\n\\n\\nCatfish, million-dollar-man\\n\\nNobody can throw the ball like Catfish can\\n\\n\\n\\nCome up where the Yankees are\\n\\nDress up in a pinstripe suit\\n\\nSmoke a custom-made cigar\\n\\nWear an alligator boot\\n\\n\\n\\nCatfish, million-dollar-man\\n\\nNobody can throw the ball like Catfish can\\n\\n\\n\\nCarolina born and bred\\n\\nLove to hunt the little quail\\n\\nGot a hundred-acre spread\\n\\nGot some huntin’ dogs for sale\\n\\n\\n\\nCatfish, million-dollar-man\\n\\nNobody can throw the ball like Catfish can\\n\\n\\n\\nReggie Jackson at the plate\\n\\nSeein’ nothin’ but the curve\\n\\nSwing too early or too late\\n\\nGot to eat what Catfish serve\\n\\n\\n\\nCatfish, million-dollar-man\\n\\nNobody can throw the ball like Catfish can\\n\\n\\n\\nEven Billy Martin grins\\n\\nWhen the Fish is in the game\\n\\nEvery season twenty wins\\n\\nGonna make the Hall of Fame\\n\\n\\n\\nCatfish, million-dollar-man\\n\\nNobody can throw the ball like Catfish can\\n\\nSmoky autumn night, stars up in the sky\\n\\nI see the sailin’ boats across the bay go by\\n\\nEucalyptus trees hang above the street\\n\\nAnd then I turn my head, for you’re approachin’ me\\n\\nMoonlight on the water, fisherman’s daughter, floatin’ in to my room\\n\\nWith a golden loom\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst we wash our feet near the immortal shrine\\n\\nAnd then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine\\n\\nI see the hungry clouds up above your face\\n\\nAnd then the tears roll down, what a bitter taste\\n\\nAnd then you drift away on a summer’s day where the wildflowers bloom\\n\\nWith your golden loom\\n\\n\\n\\nI walk across the bridge in the dismal light\\n\\nWhere all the cars are stripped between the gates of night\\n\\nI see the trembling lion with the lotus flower tail\\n\\nAnd then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil\\n\\nBut you’re gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume\\n\\nAnd your golden loom\\n\\n\\n’Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood\\n\\nWhen blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud\\n\\nI came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form\\n\\n“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd if I pass this way again, you can rest assured\\n\\nI’ll always do my best for her, on that I give my word\\n\\nIn a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm\\n\\n“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\\n\\n\\n\\nNot a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved\\n\\nEverything up to that point had been left unresolved\\n\\nTry imagining a place where it’s always safe and warm\\n\\n“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\\n\\n\\n\\nI was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail\\n\\nPoisoned in the bushes an’ blown out on the trail\\n\\nHunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn\\n\\n“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\\n\\n\\n\\nSuddenly I turned around and she was standin’ there\\n\\nWith silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair\\n\\nShe walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns\\n\\n“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\\n\\n\\n\\nNow there’s a wall between us, somethin’ there’s been lost\\n\\nI took too much for granted, got my signals crossed\\n\\nJust to think that it all began on a long-forgotten morn\\n\\n“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount\\n\\nBut nothing really matters much, it’s doom alone that counts\\n\\nAnd the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn\\n\\n“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\\n\\n\\n\\nI’ve heard newborn babies wailin’ like a mournin’ dove\\n\\nAnd old men with broken teeth stranded without love\\n\\nDo I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?\\n\\n“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes\\n\\nI bargained for salvation an’ they gave me a lethal dose\\n\\nI offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn\\n\\n“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I’m livin’ in a foreign country but I’m bound to cross the line\\n\\nBeauty walks a razor’s edge, someday I’ll make it mine\\n\\nIf I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born\\n\\n“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\\n\\nThe festival was over, the boys were all plannin’ for a fall\\n\\nThe cabaret was quiet except for the drillin’ in the wall\\n\\nThe curfew had been lifted and the gamblin’ wheel shut down\\n\\nAnyone with any sense had already left town\\n\\nHe was standin’ in the doorway lookin’ like the Jack of Hearts\\n\\n\\n\\nHe moved across the mirrored room, “Set it up for everyone,” he said\\n\\nThen everyone commenced to do what they were doin’ before he turned their heads\\n\\nThen he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin\\n\\n“Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?”\\n\\nThen he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts\\n\\n\\n\\nBackstage the girls were playin’ five-card stud by the stairs\\n\\nLily had two queens, she was hopin’ for a third to match her pair\\n\\nOutside the streets were fillin’ up, the window was open wide\\n\\nA gentle breeze was blowin’, you could feel it from inside\\n\\nLily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts\\n\\n\\n\\nBig Jim was no one’s fool, he owned the town’s only diamond mine\\n\\nHe made his usual entrance lookin’ so dandy and so fine\\n\\nWith his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place\\n\\nHe took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste\\n\\nBut his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts\\n\\n\\n\\nRosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town\\n\\nShe slipped in through the side door lookin’ like a queen without a crown\\n\\nShe fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear\\n\\n“Sorry, darlin’, that I’m late,” but he didn’t seem to hear\\n\\nHe was starin’ into space over at the Jack of Hearts\\n\\n\\n\\n“I know I’ve seen that face before,” Big Jim was thinkin’ to himself\\n\\n“Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody’s shelf”\\n\\nBut then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the houselights did dim\\n\\nAnd in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him\\n\\nStarin’ at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts\\n\\n\\n\\nLily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child\\n\\nShe did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled\\n\\nShe’d come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs\\n\\nWith men in every walk of life which took her everywhere\\n\\nBut she’d never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts\\n\\n\\n\\nThe hangin’ judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined\\n\\nThe drillin’ in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind\\n\\nIt was known all around that Lily had Jim’s ring\\n\\nAnd nothing would ever come between Lily and the king\\n\\nNo, nothin’ ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts\\n\\n\\n\\nRosemary started drinkin’ hard and seein’ her reflection in the knife\\n\\nShe was tired of the attention, tired of playin’ the role of Big Jim’s wife\\n\\nShe had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide\\n\\nWas lookin’ to do just one good deed before she died\\n\\nShe was gazin’ to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts\\n\\n\\n\\nLily washed her face, took her dress off and buried it away\\n\\n“Has your luck run out?” she laughed at him, “Well, I guess you must\\n\\n    have known it would someday\\n\\nBe careful not to touch the wall, there’s a brand-new coat of paint\\n\\nI’m glad to see you’re still alive, you’re lookin’ like a saint”\\n\\nDown the hallway footsteps were comin’ for the Jack of Hearts\\n\\n\\n\\nThe backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair\\n\\n“There’s something funny going on,” he said, “I can just feel it in the air”\\n\\nHe went to get the hangin’ judge, but the hangin’ judge was drunk\\n\\nAs the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk\\n\\nThere was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts\\n\\n\\n\\nLily’s arms were locked around the man that she dearly loved to touch\\n\\nShe forgot all about the man she couldn’t stand who hounded her so much\\n\\n“I’ve missed you so,” she said to him, and he felt she was sincere\\n\\nBut just beyond the door he felt jealousy and fear\\n\\nJust another night in the life of the Jack of Hearts\\n\\n\\n\\nNo one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick\\n\\nThe door to the dressing room burst open and a cold revolver clicked\\n\\nAnd Big Jim was standin’ there, ya couldn’t say surprised\\n\\nRosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes\\n\\nShe was with Big Jim but she was leanin’ to the Jack of Hearts\\n\\n\\n\\nTwo doors down the boys finally made it through the wall\\n\\nAnd cleaned out the bank safe, it’s said that they got off with quite a haul\\n\\nIn the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground\\n\\nFor one more member who had business back in town\\n\\nBut they couldn’t go no further without the Jack of Hearts\\n\\n\\n\\nThe next day was hangin’ day, the sky was overcast and black\\n\\nBig Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back\\n\\nAnd Rosemary on the gallows, she didn’t even blink\\n\\nThe hangin’ judge was sober, he hadn’t had a drink\\n\\nThe only person on the scene missin’ was the Jack of Hearts\\n\\n\\n\\nThe cabaret was empty now, a sign said, “Closed for repair”\\n\\nLily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair\\n\\nShe was thinkin’ ’bout her father, who she very rarely saw\\n\\nThinkin’ ’bout Rosemary and thinkin’ about the law\\n\\nBut most of all she was thinkin’ ’bout the Jack of Hearts\\n\\nBuckets of rain\\n\\nBuckets of tears\\n\\nGot all them buckets comin’ out of my ears\\n\\nBuckets of moonbeams in my hand\\n\\nI got all the love, honey baby\\n\\nYou can stand\\n\\n\\n\\nI been meek\\n\\nAnd hard like an oak\\n\\nI seen pretty people disappear like smoke\\n\\nFriends will arrive, friends will disappear\\n\\nIf you want me, honey baby\\n\\nI’ll be here\\n\\n\\n\\nLike your smile\\n\\nAnd your fingertips\\n\\nLike the way that you move your lips\\n\\nI like the cool way you look at me\\n\\nEverything about you is bringing me\\n\\nMisery\\n\\n\\n\\nLittle red wagon\\n\\nLittle red bike\\n\\nI ain’t no monkey but I know what I like\\n\\nI like the way you love me strong and slow\\n\\nI’m takin’ you with me, honey baby\\n\\nWhen I go\\n\\n\\n\\nLife is sad\\n\\nLife is a bust\\n\\nAll ya can do is do what you must\\n\\nYou do what you must do and ya do it well\\n\\nI’ll do it for you, honey baby\\n\\nCan’t you tell?\\n\\nI plan it all and I take my place\\n\\nYou break your promise all over the place\\n\\nYou promised to love me, but what do I see\\n\\nJust you comin’ and spillin’ juice over me\\n\\nOdds and ends, odds and ends\\n\\nLost time is not found again\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, you take your file and you bend my head\\n\\nI never can remember anything that you said\\n\\nYou promised to love me, but what do I know\\n\\nYou’re always spillin’ juice on me like you got someplace to go\\n\\nOdds and ends, odds and ends\\n\\nLost time is not found again\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, I’ve had enough, my box is clean\\n\\nYou know what I’m sayin’ and you know what I mean\\n\\nFrom now on you’d best get on someone else\\n\\nWhile you’re doin’ it, keep that juice to yourself\\n\\nOdds and ends, odds and ends\\n\\nLost time is not found again\\n\\nI’m going down to Rose Marie’s\\n\\nShe never does me wrong\\n\\nShe puts it to me plain as day\\n\\nAnd gives it to me for a song\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s a wicked life but what the hell\\n\\nThe stars ain’t falling down\\n\\nI’m standing outside the Taj Mahal\\n\\nI don’t see no one around\\n\\n\\n\\nGoin’ to Acapulco–goin’ on the run\\n\\nGoin’ down to see fat gut–goin’ to have some fun\\n\\nYeah–goin’ to have some fun\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, whenever I get up\\n\\nAnd I ain’t got what I see\\n\\nI just make it down to Rose Marie’s\\n\\n’Bout a quarter after three\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are worse ways of getting there\\n\\nAnd I ain’t complainin’ none\\n\\nIf the clouds don’t drop and the train don’t stop\\n\\nI’m bound to meet the sun\\n\\n\\n\\nGoin’ to Acapulco–goin’ on the run\\n\\nGoin’ down to see fat gut–goin’ to have some fun\\n\\nYeah–goin’ to have some fun\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, if someone offers me a joke\\n\\nI just say no thanks\\n\\nI try to tell it like it is\\n\\nAnd keep away from pranks\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, sometime you know when the well breaks down\\n\\nI just go pump on it some\\n\\nRose Marie, she likes to go to big places\\n\\nAnd just set there waitin’ for me to come\\n\\n\\n\\nGoin’ to Acapulco–goin’ on the run\\n\\nGoin’ down to see fat gut–goin’ to have some fun\\n\\nYeah–goin’ to have some fun\\n\\nEarly one mornin’ the sun was shinin’\\n\\nI was layin’ in bed\\n\\nWond’rin’ if she’d changed at all\\n\\nIf her hair was still red\\n\\nHer folks they said our lives together\\n\\nSure was gonna be rough\\n\\nThey never did like Mama’s homemade dress\\n\\nPapa’s bankbook wasn’t big enough\\n\\nAnd I was standin’ on the side of the road\\n\\nRain fallin’ on my shoes\\n\\nHeading out for the East Coast\\n\\nLord knows I’ve paid some dues gettin’ through\\n\\nTangled up in blue\\n\\n\\n\\nShe was married when we first met\\n\\nSoon to be divorced\\n\\nI helped her out of a jam, I guess\\n\\nBut I used a little too much force\\n\\nWe drove that car as far as we could\\n\\nAbandoned it out West\\n\\nSplit up on a dark sad night\\n\\nBoth agreeing it was best\\n\\nShe turned around to look at me\\n\\nAs I was walkin’ away\\n\\nI heard her say over my shoulder\\n\\n“We’ll meet again someday on the avenue”\\n\\nTangled up in blue\\n\\n\\n\\nI had a job in the great north woods\\n\\nWorking as a cook for a spell\\n\\nBut I never did like it all that much\\n\\nAnd one day the ax just fell\\n\\nSo I drifted down to New Orleans\\n\\nWhere I happened to be employed\\n\\nWorkin’ for a while on a fishin’ boat\\n\\nRight outside of Delacroix\\n\\nBut all the while I was alone\\n\\nThe past was close behind\\n\\nI seen a lot of women\\n\\nBut she never escaped my mind, and I just grew\\n\\nTangled up in blue\\n\\n\\n\\nShe was workin’ in a topless place\\n\\nAnd I stopped in for a beer\\n\\nI just kept lookin’ at the side of her face\\n\\nIn the spotlight so clear\\n\\nAnd later on as the crowd thinned out\\n\\nI’s just about to do the same\\n\\nShe was standing there in back of my chair\\n\\nSaid to me, “Don’t I know your name?”\\n\\nI muttered somethin’ underneath my breath\\n\\nShe studied the lines on my face\\n\\nI must admit I felt a little uneasy\\n\\nWhen she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe\\n\\nTangled up in blue\\n\\n\\n\\nShe lit a burner on the stove\\n\\nAnd offered me a pipe\\n\\n“I thought you’d never say hello,” she said\\n\\n“You look like the silent type”\\n\\nThen she opened up a book of poems\\n\\nAnd handed it to me\\n\\nWritten by an Italian poet\\n\\nFrom the thirteenth century\\n\\nAnd every one of them words rang true\\n\\nAnd glowed like burnin’ coal\\n\\nPourin’ off of every page\\n\\nLike it was written in my soul from me to you\\n\\nTangled up in blue\\n\\n\\n\\nI lived with them on Montague Street\\n\\nIn a basement down the stairs\\n\\nThere was music in the cafés at night\\n\\nAnd revolution in the air\\n\\nThen he started into dealing with slaves\\n\\nAnd something inside of him died\\n\\nShe had to sell everything she owned\\n\\nAnd froze up inside\\n\\nAnd when finally the bottom fell out\\n\\nI became withdrawn\\n\\nThe only thing I knew how to do\\n\\nWas to keep on keepin’ on like a bird that flew\\n\\nTangled up in blue\\n\\n\\n\\nSo now I’m goin’ back again\\n\\nI got to get to her somehow\\n\\nAll the people we used to know\\n\\nThey’re an illusion to me now\\n\\nSome are mathematicians\\n\\nSome are carpenters’ wives\\n\\nDon’t know how it all got started\\n\\nI don’t know what they’re doin’ with their lives\\n\\nBut me, I’m still on the road\\n\\nHeadin’ for another joint\\n\\nWe always did feel the same\\n\\nWe just saw it from a different point of view\\n\\nTangled up in blue\\n\\nIf you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier\\n\\nIt’s the city ’cross the water, not too far from here\\n\\nSay for me that I’m all right though things are kind of slow\\n\\nShe might think that I’ve forgotten her. Don’t tell her it isn’t so\\n\\n\\n\\nWe had a falling-out, like lovers sometimes do\\n\\nBut to think of how she left that night, it hurts me through and through\\n\\nAnd though our situation pierced me to the bone\\n\\nI got to find someone to take her place. I don’t like to be alone\\n\\n\\n\\nI see a lot of people as I make the rounds\\n\\nAnd I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town\\n\\nAnd I’ve never gotten used to it, I’ve just learned to turn it off\\n\\nHer eyes were blue, her hair was too, her skin so sweet and soft\\n\\n\\n\\nSundown, yellow moon, I replay the past\\n\\nI know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast\\n\\nIf she’s passin’ back this way, and I sure hope she don’t\\n\\nTell her she can look me up. I’ll either be here or I won’t\\n\\nWell, that big dumb blonde\\n\\nWith her wheel in the gorge\\n\\nAnd Turtle, that friend of theirs\\n\\nWith his checks all forged\\n\\nAnd his cheeks in a chunk\\n\\nWith his cheese in the cash\\n\\nThey’re all gonna be there\\n\\nAt that million dollar bash\\n\\nOoh, baby, ooh-ee\\n\\nOoh, baby, ooh-ee\\n\\nIt’s that million dollar bash\\n\\n\\n\\nEv’rybody from right now\\n\\nTo over there and back\\n\\nThe louder they come\\n\\nThe harder they crack\\n\\nCome now, sweet cream\\n\\nDon’t forget to flash\\n\\nWe’re all gonna meet\\n\\nAt that million dollar bash\\n\\nOoh, baby, ooh-ee\\n\\nOoh, baby, ooh-ee\\n\\nIt’s that million dollar bash\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I took my counselor\\n\\nOut to the barn\\n\\nSilly Nelly was there\\n\\nShe told him a yarn\\n\\nThen along came Jones\\n\\nEmptied the trash\\n\\nEv’rybody went down\\n\\nTo that million dollar bash\\n\\nOoh, baby, ooh-ee\\n\\nOoh, baby, ooh-ee\\n\\nIt’s that million dollar bash\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I’m hittin’ it too hard\\n\\nMy stones won’t take\\n\\nI get up in the mornin’\\n\\nBut it’s too early to wake\\n\\nFirst it’s hello, goodbye\\n\\nThen push and then crash\\n\\nBut we’re all gonna make it\\n\\nAt that million dollar bash\\n\\nOoh, baby, ooh-ee\\n\\nOoh, baby, ooh-ee\\n\\nIt’s that million dollar bash\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I looked at my watch\\n\\nI looked at my wrist\\n\\nPunched myself in the face\\n\\nWith my fist\\n\\nI took my potatoes\\n\\nDown to be mashed\\n\\nThen I made it over\\n\\nTo that million dollar bash\\n\\nOoh, baby, ooh-ee\\n\\nOoh, baby, ooh-ee\\n\\nIt’s that million dollar bash\\n\\nSomeone’s got it in for me, they’re planting stories in the press\\n\\nWhoever it is I wish they’d cut it out but when they will I can only guess\\n\\nThey say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy\\n\\nShe inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me\\n\\nI can’t help it if I’m lucky\\n\\n\\n\\nPeople see me all the time and they just can’t remember how to act\\n\\nTheir minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts\\n\\nEven you, yesterday you had to ask me where it was at\\n\\nI couldn’t believe after all these years, you didn’t know me better than that\\n\\nSweet lady\\n\\n\\n\\nIdiot wind, blowing every time you move your mouth\\n\\nBlowing down the backroads headin’ south\\n\\nIdiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth\\n\\nYou’re an idiot, babe\\n\\nIt’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe\\n\\n\\n\\nI ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike\\n\\nI haven’t known peace and quiet for so long I can’t remember what it’s like\\n\\nThere’s a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pourin’ out of a boxcar door\\n\\nYou didn’t know it, you didn’t think it could be done, in the final end he won the wars\\n\\nAfter losin’ every battle\\n\\n\\n\\nI woke up on the roadside, daydreamin’ ’bout the way things sometimes are\\n\\nVisions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are makin’ me see stars\\n\\nYou hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies\\n\\nOne day you’ll be in the ditch, flies buzzin’ around your eyes\\n\\nBlood on your saddle\\n\\n\\n\\nIdiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb\\n\\nBlowing through the curtains in your room\\n\\nIdiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth\\n\\nYou’re an idiot, babe\\n\\nIt’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart\\n\\nYou tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn’t enough to change my heart\\n\\nNow everything’s a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped\\n\\nWhat’s good is bad, what’s bad is good, you’ll find out when you reach the top\\n\\nYou’re on the bottom\\n\\n\\n\\nI noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blind\\n\\nI can’t remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes\\n\\n    don’t look into mine\\n\\nThe priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the\\n\\n    building burned\\n\\nI waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees, while the\\n\\n    springtime turned\\n\\nSlowly into Autumn\\n\\n\\n\\nIdiot wind, blowing like a circle around my skull\\n\\nFrom the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol\\n\\nIdiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth\\n\\nYou’re an idiot, babe\\n\\nIt’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe\\n\\n\\n\\nI can’t feel you anymore, I can’t even touch the books you’ve read\\n\\nEvery time I crawl past your door, I been wishin’ I was somebody else instead\\n\\nDown the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy\\n\\nI followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory\\n\\nAnd all your ragin’ glory\\n\\n\\n\\nI been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I’m finally free\\n\\nI kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me\\n\\nYou’ll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above\\n\\nAnd I’ll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love\\n\\nAnd it makes me feel so sorry\\n\\n\\n\\nIdiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats\\n\\nBlowing through the letters that we wrote\\n\\nIdiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves\\n\\nWe’re idiots, babe\\n\\nIt’s a wonder we can even feed ourselves\\n\\nI pulled out for San Anton’\\n\\nI never felt so good\\n\\nMy woman said she’d meet me there\\n\\nAnd of course, I knew she would\\n\\nThe coachman, he hit me for my hook\\n\\nAnd he asked me my name\\n\\nI give it to him right away\\n\\nThen I hung my head in shame\\n\\nLo and behold! Lo and behold!\\n\\nLookin’ for my lo and behold\\n\\nGet me outa here, my dear man!\\n\\n\\n\\nI come into Pittsburgh\\n\\nAt six-thirty flat\\n\\nI found myself a vacant seat\\n\\nAn’ I put down my hat\\n\\n“What’s the matter, Molly, dear\\n\\nWhat’s the matter with your mound?”\\n\\n“What’s it to ya, Moby Dick?\\n\\nThis is chicken town!”\\n\\nLo and behold! Lo and behold!\\n\\nLookin’ for my lo and behold\\n\\nGet me outa here, my dear man!\\n\\n\\n\\nI bought my girl\\n\\nA herd of moose\\n\\nOne she could call her own\\n\\nWell, she came out the very next day\\n\\nTo see where they had flown\\n\\nI’m goin’ down to Tennessee\\n\\nGet me a truck ‘r somethin’\\n\\nGonna save my money and rip it up!\\n\\nLo and behold! Lo and behold!\\n\\nLookin’ for my lo and behold\\n\\nGet me outa here, my dear man!\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, I come in on a Ferris wheel\\n\\nAn’ boys, I sure was slick\\n\\nI come in like a ton of bricks\\n\\nLaid a few tricks on ’em\\n\\nGoin’ back to Pittsburgh\\n\\nCount up to thirty\\n\\nRound that horn and ride that herd\\n\\nGonna thread up!\\n\\nLo and behold! Lo and behold!\\n\\nLookin’ for my lo and behold\\n\\nGet me outa here, my dear man!\\n\\nOld man sailin’ in a dinghy boat\\n\\nDown there\\n\\nOld man down is baitin’ a hook\\n\\nOn there\\n\\nGonna

asked, “What do you care?”\\n\\nPapa said, “Well, just because”\\n\\nThen they started to take back their clothes\\n\\nHang ’em on the line\\n\\nIt was January the thirtieth\\n\\nAnd everybody was

upper hall\\n\\nShe sees the bartender in a pool of blood\\n\\nCries out, “My God, they killed them all!”\\n\\nHere comes the story of the Hurricane\\n\\nThe man the authorities came to blame\\n\\nFor somethin’ that he never done\\n\\nPut in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been\\n\\nThe champion of the world\\n\\n\\n\\nThree bodies lyin’ there does Patty see\\n\\nAnd another man named Bello, movin’ around mysteriously\\n\\n“I didn’t do it,” he says, and he throws up his hands\\n\\n“I was only robbin’ the register, I hope you understand\\n\\nI saw them leavin’,” he says, and he stops\\n\\n“One of us had better call up the cops”\\n\\nAnd so Patty calls the cops\\n\\nAnd they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin’\\n\\nIn the hot New Jersey night\\n\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, far away in another part of town\\n\\nRubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin’ around\\n\\nNumber one contender for the middleweight crown\\n\\nHad no idea what kinda shit was about to go down\\n\\nWhen a cop pulled him over to the side of the road\\n\\nJust like the time before and the time before that\\n\\nIn Paterson that’s just the way things go\\n\\nIf you’re black you might as well not show up on the street\\n\\n’Less you wanna draw the heat\\n\\n\\n\\nAlfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops\\n\\nHim and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin’ around\\n\\nHe said, “I saw two men runnin’ out, they looked like middleweights\\n\\nThey jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates”\\n\\nAnd Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head\\n\\nCop said, “Wait a minute, boys, this one’s not dead”\\n\\nSo they took him to the infirmary\\n\\nAnd though this man could hardly see\\n\\nThey told him that he could identify the guilty men\\n\\n\\n\\nFour in the mornin’ and they haul Rubin in\\n\\nTake him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs\\n\\nThe wounded man looks up through his one dyin’ eye\\n\\nSays, “Wha’d you bring him in here for? He ain’t the guy!”\\n\\nYes, here’s the story of the Hurricane\\n\\nThe man the authorities came to blame\\n\\nFor somethin’ that he never done\\n\\nPut in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been\\n\\nThe champion of the world\\n\\n\\n\\nFour months later, the ghettos are in flame\\n\\nRubin’s in South America, fightin’ for his name\\n\\nWhile Arthur Dexter Bradley’s still in the robbery game\\n\\nAnd the cops are puttin’ the screws to him, lookin’ for somebody to blame\\n\\n“Remember that murder that happened in a bar?”\\n\\n“Remember you said you saw the getaway car?”\\n\\n“You think you’d like to play ball with the law?”\\n\\n“Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin’ that night?”\\n\\n“Don’t forget that you are white”\\n\\n\\n\\nArthur Dexter Bradley said, “I’m really not sure”\\n\\nCops said, “A poor boy like you could use a break\\n\\nWe got you for the motel job and we’re talkin’ to your friend Bello\\n\\nNow you don’t wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow\\n\\nYou’ll be doin’ society a favor\\n\\nThat sonofabitch is brave and gettin’ braver\\n\\nWe want to put his ass in stir\\n\\nWe want to pin this triple murder on him\\n\\nHe ain’t no Gentleman Jim”\\n\\n\\n\\nRubin could take a man out with just one punch\\n\\nBut he never did like to talk about it all that much\\n\\nIt’s my work, he’d say, and I do it for pay\\n\\nAnd when it’s over I’d just as soon go on my way\\n\\nUp to some paradise\\n\\nWhere the trout streams flow and the air is nice\\n\\nAnd ride a horse along a trail\\n\\nBut then they took him to the jailhouse\\n\\nWhere they try to turn a man into a mouse\\n\\n\\n\\nAll of Rubin’s cards were marked in advance\\n\\nThe trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance\\n\\nThe judge made Rubin’s witnesses drunkards from the slums\\n\\nTo the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum\\n\\nAnd to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger\\n\\nNo one doubted that he pulled the trigger\\n\\nAnd though they could not produce the gun\\n\\nThe D.A. said he was the one who did the deed\\n\\nAnd the all-white jury agreed\\n\\n\\n\\nRubin Carter was falsely tried\\n\\nThe crime was murder “one,” guess who testified?\\n\\nBello and Bradley and they both baldly lied\\n\\nAnd the newspapers, they all went along for the ride\\n\\nHow can the life of such a man\\n\\nBe in the palm of some fool’s hand?\\n\\nTo see him obviously framed\\n\\nCouldn’t help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land\\n\\nWhere justice is a game\\n\\n\\n\\nNow all the criminals in their coats and their ties\\n\\nAre free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise\\n\\nWhile Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell\\n\\nAn innocent man in a living hell\\n\\nThat’s the story of the Hurricane\\n\\nBut it won’t be over till they clear his name\\n\\nAnd give him back the time he’s done\\n\\nPut in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been\\n\\nThe champion of the world\\n\\n\\nI

glance\\n\\n\\n\\nLying next to her by the ocean\\n\\nReaching out and touching her hand\\n\\nWhispering your secret emotion\\n\\nMagic in a magical land\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd when it’s time for leaving

bar\\n\\nThem playin’ leapfrog and hearin’ about Snow White\\n\\nYou in the marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar\\n\\n\\n\\nSara, Sara\\n\\nIt’s all so clear, I could never forget\\n\\nSara, Sara\\n\\nLovin’ you is the one thing I’ll never regret\\n\\n\\n\\nI can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells\\n\\nI’d taken the cure and had just gotten through\\n\\nStayin’ up for days in the Chelsea Hotel\\n\\nWritin’ “Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands” for you\\n\\n\\n\\nSara, Sara\\n\\nWherever we travel we’re never apart\\n\\nSara, oh Sara\\n\\nBeautiful lady, so dear to my heart\\n\\n\\n\\nHow did I meet you? I don’t know\\n\\nA messenger sent me in a tropical storm\\n\\nYou were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow\\n\\nAnd on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm\\n\\n\\n\\nSara, oh Sara\\n\\nScorpio Sphinx in a calico dress\\n\\nSara, Sara\\n\\nYou must forgive me my unworthiness\\n\\n\\n\\nNow the beach is deserted except for some kelp\\n\\nAnd a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore\\n\\nYou always responded when I needed your help\\n\\nYou gimme a map and a key to your door\\n\\n\\n\\nSara, oh Sara\\n\\nGlamorous nymph with an arrow and bow\\n\\nSara, oh Sara\\n\\nDon’t ever leave me, don’t ever go\\n\\n\\nI married Isis on the fifth day of May\\n\\nBut I could not hold on to her very long\\n\\nSo I cut off my hair and I rode straight away\\n\\nFor the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong\\n\\n\\n\\nI came to a high place of darkness and light\\n\\nThe dividing line ran through the center of town\\n\\nI hitched up my pony to a post on the right\\n\\nWent in to a laundry to wash my clothes down\\n\\n\\n\\nA man in the corner approached me for a match\\n\\nI knew right away he was not ordinary\\n\\nHe said, “Are you lookin’ for somethin’ easy to catch?”\\n\\nI said, “I got no money.” He said, “That ain’t necessary”\\n\\n\\n\\nWe set out that night for the cold in the North\\n\\nI gave him my blanket, he gave me his word\\n\\nI said, “Where are we goin’?” He said we’d be back by the fourth\\n\\nI said, “That’s the best news that I’ve ever heard”\\n\\n\\n\\nI was thinkin’ about turquoise, I was thinkin’ about gold\\n\\nI was thinkin’ about diamonds and the world’s biggest necklace\\n\\nAs we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold\\n\\nI was thinkin’ about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless\\n\\n\\n\\nHow she told me that one day we would meet up again\\n\\nAnd things would be different the next time we wed\\n\\nIf I only could hang on and just be her friend\\n\\nI still can’t remember all the best things she said\\n\\n\\n\\nWe came to the pyramids all embedded in ice\\n\\nHe said, “There’s a body I’m tryin’ to find\\n\\nIf I carry it out it’ll bring a good price”\\n\\n’Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind\\n\\n\\n\\nThe wind it was howlin’ and the snow was outrageous\\n\\nWe chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn\\n\\nWhen he died I was hopin’ that it wasn’t contagious\\n\\nBut I made up my mind that I had to go on\\n\\n\\n\\nI broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty\\n\\nThere was no jewels, no nothin’, I felt I’d been had\\n\\nWhen I saw that my partner was just bein’ friendly\\n\\nWhen I took up his offer I must-a been mad\\n\\n\\n\\nI picked up his body and I dragged him inside\\n\\nThrew him down in the hole and I put back the cover\\n\\nI said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied\\n\\nThen I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her\\n\\n\\n\\nShe was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise\\n\\nBlinded by sleep and in need of a bed\\n\\nI came in from the East with the sun in my eyes\\n\\nI cursed her one time then I rode on ahead\\n\\n\\n\\nShe said, “Where ya been?” I said, “No place special”\\n\\nShe said, “You look different.” I said, “Well, not quite”\\n\\nShe said, “You been gone.” I said, “That’s only natural”\\n\\nShe said, “You gonna stay?” I said, “Yeah, I jes might”\\n\\n\\n\\nIsis, oh, Isis, you mystical child\\n\\nWhat drives me to you is what drives me insane\\n\\nI still can remember the way that you smiled\\n\\nOn the fifth day of May in the drizzlin’ rain\\n\\nHot chili peppers in the blistering sun\\n\\nDust on my face and my cape\\n\\nMe and Magdalena on the run\\n\\nI think this time we shall escape\\n\\n\\n\\nSold my guitar to the baker’s son\\n\\nFor a few crumbs and a place to hide\\n\\nBut I can get another one\\n\\nAnd I’ll play for Magdalena as we ride\\n\\n\\n\\nNo llores, mi querida\\n\\nDios nos vigila\\n\\nSoon the horse will take us to Durango\\n\\nAgarrame, mi vida\\n\\nSoon the desert will be gone\\n\\nSoon you will be dancing the fandango\\n\\n\\n\\nPast the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people\\n\\nHoofbeats like castanets on stone\\n\\nAt night I dream of bells in the village steeple\\n\\nThen I see the bloody face of Ramon\\n\\n\\n\\nWas it me that shot him down in the cantina\\n\\nWas it my hand that held the gun?\\n\\nCome, let us fly, my Magdalena\\n\\nThe dogs are barking and what’s done is done\\n\\n\\n\\nNo Ilores, mi querida\\n\\nDios nos vigila\\n\\nSoon the horse will take us to Durango\\n\\nAgarrame, mi vida\\n\\nSoon the desert will be gone\\n\\nSoon you will be dancing the fandango\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the corrida we’ll sit in the shade\\n\\nAnd watch the young torero stand alone\\n\\nWe’ll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed\\n\\nWhen they rode with Villa into Torreón\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the padre will recite the prayers of old\\n\\nIn the little church this side of town\\n\\nI will wear new boots and an earring of gold\\n\\nYou’ll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown\\n\\n\\n\\nThe way is long but the end is near\\n\\nAlready the fiesta has begun\\n\\nThe face of God will appear\\n\\nWith His serpent eyes of obsidian\\n\\n\\n\\nNo Ilores, mi querida\\n\\nDio nos vigila\\n\\nSoon the horse will take us to Durango\\n\\nAgarrame, mi vida\\n\\nSoon the desert will be gone\\n\\nSoon you will be dancing the fandango\\n\\n\\n\\nWas that the thunder that I heard?\\n\\nMy head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain\\n\\nCome sit by me, don’t say a word\\n\\nOh, can it be that I am slain?\\n\\n\\n\\nQuick, Magdalena, take my gun\\n\\nLook up in the hills, that flash of light\\n\\nAim well my little one\\n\\nWe may not make it through the night\\n\\n\\n\\nNo Ilores, mi querida\\n\\nDios nos vigila\\n\\nSoon the horse will take us to Durango\\n\\nAgarrame, mi vida\\n\\nSoon the desert will be gone\\n\\nSoon you will be dancing the fandango\\n\\nUp on the white veranda\\n\\nShe wears a necktie and a Panama hat\\n\\nHer passport shows a face\\n\\nFrom another time and place\\n\\nShe looks nothin’ like that\\n\\nAnd all the remnants of her recent past\\n\\nAre scattered in the wild wind\\n\\nShe walks across the marble floor\\n\\nWhere a voice from the gambling room is callin’ her to come on in\\n\\nShe smiles, walks the other way\\n\\nAs the last ship sails and the moon fades away\\n\\nFrom Black Diamond Bay\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the mornin’ light breaks open, the Greek comes down\\n\\nAnd he asks for a rope and a pen that will write\\n\\n“Pardon, monsieur,” the desk clerk says\\n\\nCarefully removes his fez\\n\\n“Am I hearin’ you right?”\\n\\nAnd as the yellow fog is liftin’\\n\\nThe Greek is quickly headin’ for the second floor\\n\\nShe passes him on the spiral staircase\\n\\nThinkin’ he’s the Soviet Ambassador\\n\\nShe starts to speak, but he walks away\\n\\nAs the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway\\n\\nOn Black Diamond Bay\\n\\n\\n\\nA soldier sits beneath the fan\\n\\nDoin’ business with a tiny man who sells him a ring\\n\\nLightning strikes, the lights blow out\\n\\nThe desk clerk wakes and begins to shout\\n\\n“Can you see anything?”\\n\\nThen the Greek appears on the second floor\\n\\nIn his bare feet with a rope around his neck\\n\\nWhile a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle\\n\\nSays, “Open up another deck”\\n\\nBut the dealer says, “Attendez-vous, s’il vous plait”\\n\\nAs the rain beats down and the cranes fly away\\n\\nFrom Black Diamond Bay\\n\\n\\n\\nThe desk clerk heard the woman laugh\\n\\nAs he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough\\n\\nHe tried to grab the woman’s hand\\n\\nSaid, “Here’s a ring, it cost a grand”\\n\\nShe said, “That ain’t enough”\\n\\nThen she ran upstairs to pack her bags\\n\\nWhile a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb\\n\\nShe passed the door that the Greek had locked\\n\\nWhere a handwritten sign read, “Do Not Disturb”\\n\\nShe knocked upon it anyway\\n\\nAs the sun went down and the music did play\\n\\nOn Black Diamond Bay\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’ve got to talk to someone quick!”\\n\\nBut the Greek said, “Go away,” and he kicked the chair to the floor\\n\\nHe hung there from the chandelier\\n\\nShe cried, “Help, there’s danger near\\n\\nPlease open up the door!”\\n\\nThen the volcano erupted\\n\\nAnd the lava flowed down from the mountain high above\\n\\nThe soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner\\n\\nThinking of forbidden love\\n\\nBut the desk clerk said, “It happens every day”\\n\\nAs the stars fell down and the fields burned away\\n\\nOn Black Diamond Bay\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the island slowly sank\\n\\nThe loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room\\n\\nThe dealer said, “It’s too late now\\n\\nYou can take your money, but I don’t know how\\n\\nYou’ll spend it in the tomb”\\n\\nThe tiny man bit the soldier’s ear\\n\\nAs the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew\\n\\nWhile she’s out on the balcony, where a stranger tells her\\n\\n“My darling, je vous aime beaucoup”\\n\\nShe sheds a tear and then begins to pray\\n\\nAs the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away\\n\\nFrom Black Diamond Bay\\n\\n\\n\\nI was sittin’ home alone one night in L.A.\\n\\nWatchin’ old Cronkite on the seven o’clock news\\n\\nIt seems there was an earthquake that\\n\\nLeft nothin’ but a Panama hat\\n\\nAnd a pair of old Greek shoes\\n\\nDidn’t seem like much was happenin’,\\n\\nSo I turned it off and went to grab another beer\\n\\nSeems like every time you turn around\\n\\nThere’s another hard-luck story that you’re gonna hear\\n\\nAnd there’s really nothin’ anyone can say\\n\\nAnd I never did plan to go anyway\\n\\nTo Black Diamond Bay\\n\\nSeven days, seven more days she’ll be comin’\\n\\nI’ll be waiting at the station for her to arrive\\n\\nSeven more days, all I gotta do is survive\\n\\n\\n\\nShe been gone ever since I been a child\\n\\nEver since I seen her smile, I ain’t forgotten her eyes\\n\\nShe had a face that could outshine the sun in the skies\\n\\n\\n\\nI been good, I been good while I been waitin’\\n\\nMaybe guilty of hesitatin’, I just been holdin’ on\\n\\nSeven more days, all that’ll be gone\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s kissing in the valley\\n\\nThieving in the alley\\n\\nFighting every inch of the way\\n\\nTrying to be tender\\n\\nWith somebody I remember\\n\\nIn a night that’s always brighter’n the day\\n\\n\\n\\nSeven days, seven more days that are connected\\n\\nJust like I expected, she’ll be comin’ on forth\\n\\nMy beautiful comrade from the north\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s kissing in the valley\\n\\nThieving in the alley\\n\\nFighting every inch of the way\\n\\nTrying to be tender\\n\\nWith somebody I remember\\n\\nIn a night that’s always brighter’n the day\\n\\nBorn in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when\\n\\nOpened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion\\n\\nAlways on the outside of whatever side there was\\n\\nWhen they asked him why it had to be that way, “Well,” he answered,\\n\\n    “just because”\\n\\n\\n\\nLarry was the oldest, Joey was next to last\\n\\nThey called Joe “Crazy,” the baby they called “Kid Blast”\\n\\nSome say they lived off gambling and runnin’ numbers too\\n\\nIt always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue\\n\\n\\n\\nJoey, Joey\\n\\nKing of the streets, child of clay\\n\\nJoey, Joey\\n\\nWhat made them want to come and blow you away?\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that\\n\\nNo one ever knew for sure where they were really at\\n\\nWhen they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost hit the roof\\n\\nHe went out that night to seek revenge, thinkin’ he was bulletproof\\n\\n\\n\\nThe war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets\\n\\nJoey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats\\n\\nTill they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners\\n\\nThey stashed them away in a basement, called them amateurs\\n\\n\\n\\nThe hostages were tremblin’ when they heard a man exclaim\\n\\n“Let’s blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame”\\n\\nBut Joey stepped up, he raised his hand, said, “We’re not those kind of men\\n\\nIt’s peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again”\\n\\n\\n\\nJoey, Joey\\n\\nKing of the streets, child of clay\\n\\nJoey, Joey\\n\\nWhat made them want to come and blow you away?\\n\\n\\n\\nThe police department hounded him, they called him Mr. Smith\\n\\nThey got him on conspiracy, they were never sure who with\\n\\n“What time is it?” said the judge to Joey when they met\\n\\n“Five to ten,” said Joey. The judge says, “That’s exactly what you get”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich\\n\\nThey threw him in the hole one time for tryin’ to stop a strike\\n\\nHis closest friends were black men ’cause they seemed to understand\\n\\nWhat it’s like to be in society with a shackle on your hand\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen they let him out in ’71 he’d lost a little weight\\n\\nBut he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great\\n\\nHe tried to find the way back into the life he left behind\\n\\nTo the boss he said, “I have returned and now I want what’s mine”\\n\\n\\n\\nJoey, Joey\\n\\nKing of the streets, child of clay\\n\\nJoey, Joey\\n\\nWhy did they have to come and blow you away?\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun\\n\\n“I’m around too many children,” he’d say, “they should never know of one”\\n\\nYet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe\\n\\nEmptied out the register, said, “Tell ’em it was Crazy Joe”\\n\\n\\n\\nOne day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York\\n\\nHe could see it comin’ through the door as he lifted up his fork\\n\\nHe pushed the table over to protect his family\\n\\nThen he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy\\n\\n\\n\\nJoey, Joey\\n\\nKing of the streets, child of clay\\n\\nJoey, Joey\\n\\nWhat made them want to come and blow you away?\\n\\n\\n\\nSister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep\\n\\nI heard his best friend Frankie say, “He ain’t dead, he’s just asleep”\\n\\nThen I saw the old man’s limousine head back towards the grave\\n\\nI guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned\\n\\nThey said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born\\n\\nAnd someday if God’s in heaven overlookin’ His preserve\\n\\nI know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve\\n\\n\\n\\nJoey, Joey\\n\\nKing of the streets, child of clay\\n\\nJoey, Joey\\n\\nWhat made them want to come and blow you away?\\n\\nOh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms\\n\\nYou should not treat me like a stranger\\n\\nOur Father would not like the way that you act\\n\\nAnd you must realize the danger\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, sister, am I not a brother to you\\n\\nAnd one deserving of affection?\\n\\nAnd is our purpose not the same on this earth\\n\\nTo love and follow His direction?\\n\\n\\n\\nWe grew up together\\n\\nFrom the cradle to the grave\\n\\nWe died and were reborn\\n\\nAnd then mysteriously saved\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, sister, when I come to knock on your door\\n\\nDon’t turn away, you’ll create sorrow\\n\\nTime is an ocean but it ends at the shore\\n\\nYou may not see me tomorrow\\n\\n\\nYou been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe\\n\\nBut you’re back where you belong\\n\\nGo get me my pistol, babe\\n\\nHoney, I can’t tell right from wrong\\n\\n\\n\\nBaby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying\\n\\nBaby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying\\n\\nBaby, please stop crying\\n\\nYou know, I know, the sun will always shine\\n\\nSo baby, please stop crying ’cause it’s tearing up my mind\\n\\n\\n\\nGo down to the river, babe\\n\\nHoney, I will meet you there\\n\\nGo down to the river, babe\\n\\nHoney, I will pay your fare\\n\\n\\n\\nBaby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying\\n\\nBaby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying\\n\\nBaby, please stop crying\\n\\nYou know, I know, the sun will always shine\\n\\nSo baby, please stop crying ’cause it’s tearing up my mind\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you’re looking for assistance, babe\\n\\nOr if you just want some company\\n\\nOr if you just want a friend you can talk to\\n\\nHoney, come and see about me\\n\\n\\n\\nBaby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying\\n\\nBaby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying\\n\\nBaby, please stop crying\\n\\nYou know, I know, the sun will always shine\\n\\nSo baby, please stop crying ’cause it’s tearing up my mind\\n\\n\\n\\nYou been hurt so many times\\n\\nAnd I know what you’re thinking of\\n\\nWell, I don’t have to be no doctor, babe\\n\\nTo see that you’re madly in love\\n\\n\\n\\nBaby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying\\n\\nBaby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying\\n\\nBaby, please stop crying\\n\\nYou know, I know, the sun will always shine\\n\\nSo baby, please stop crying ’cause it’s tearing up my mind\\n\\nDo you love me, or are you just extending goodwill?\\n\\nDo you need me half as bad as you say, or are you just feeling guilt?\\n\\nI’ve been burned before and I know the score\\n\\nSo you won’t hear me complain\\n\\nWill I be able to count on you\\n\\nOr is your love in vain?\\n\\n\\n\\nAre you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?\\n\\nWhen I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?\\n\\nDo you know my world, do you know my kind\\n\\nOr must I explain?\\n\\nWill you let me be myself\\n\\nOr is your love in vain?\\n\\n\\n\\nWell I’ve been to the mountain and I’ve been in the wind\\n\\nI’ve been in and out of happiness\\n\\nI have dined with kings, I’ve been offered wings\\n\\nAnd I’ve never been too impressed\\n\\n\\n\\nAll right, I’ll take a chance, I will fall in love with you\\n\\nIf I’m a fool you can have the night, you can have the morning too\\n\\nCan you cook and sew, make flowers grow\\n\\nDo you understand my pain?\\n\\nAre you willing to risk it all\\n\\nOr is your love in vain?\\n\\nSeñor, señor, do you know where we’re headin’?\\n\\nLincoln County Road or Armageddon?\\n\\nSeems like I been down this way before\\n\\nIs there any truth in that, señor?\\n\\n\\n\\nSeñor, señor, do you know where she is hidin’?\\n\\nHow long are we gonna be ridin’?\\n\\nHow long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?\\n\\nWill there be any comfort there, señor?\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s a wicked wind still blowin’ on that upper deck\\n\\nThere’s an iron cross still hangin\\' down from around her neck\\n\\nThere’s a marchin’ band still playin’ in that vacant lot\\n\\nWhere she held me in her arms one time and said, “Forget me not”\\n\\n\\n\\nSeñor, señor, I can see that painted wagon\\n\\nI can smell the tail of the dragon\\n\\nCan’t stand the suspense anymore\\n\\nCan you tell me who to contact here, señor?\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled\\n\\nWas that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field\\n\\nA gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring\\n\\nSaid, “Son, this ain’t a dream no more, it’s the real thing”\\n\\n\\n\\nSeñor, señor, you know their hearts is as hard as leather\\n\\nWell, give me a minute, let me get it together\\n\\nI just gotta pick myself up off the floor\\n\\nI’m ready when you are, señor\\n\\n\\n\\nSeñor, señor, let’s disconnect these cables\\n\\nOverturn these tables\\n\\nThis place don’t make sense to me no more\\n\\nCan you tell me what we’re waiting for, señor?\\n\\nOnce I had a pony, her name was Lucifer\\n\\nI had a pony, her name was Lucifer\\n\\nShe broke her leg and she needed shooting\\n\\nI swear it hurt me more than it could ever have hurted her\\n\\n\\n\\nSometimes I wonder what’s going on in the mind of Miss X\\n\\nSometimes I wonder what’s going on in the mind of Miss X\\n\\nYou know she got such a sweet disposition\\n\\nI never know what the poor girl’s gonna do to me next\\n\\n\\n\\nI got a new pony, she knows how to fox-trot, lope and pace\\n\\nWell, I got a new pony, she knows how to fox-trot, lope and pace\\n\\nShe got great big hind legs\\n\\nAnd long black shaggy hair above her face\\n\\n\\n\\nWell now, it was early in the mornin’, I seen your shadow in the door\\n\\nIt was early in the mornin’, I seen your shadow in the door\\n\\nNow, I don’t have to ask nobody\\n\\nI know what you come here for\\n\\n\\n\\nThey say you’re usin’ voodoo, your feet walk by themselves\\n\\nThey say you’re usin’ voodoo, I seen your feet walk by themselves\\n\\nOh, baby, that god you been prayin’ to\\n\\nIs gonna give ya back what you’re wishin’ on someone else\\n\\n\\n\\nCome over here pony, I, I wanna climb up one time on you\\n\\nCome over here pony, I, I wanna climb up one time on you\\n\\nWell, you’re so bad and nasty\\n\\nBut I love you, yes I do\\n\\nIn death, you face life with a child and a wife\\n\\nWho sleep-walks through your dreams into walls\\n\\nYou’re a soldier of mercy, you’re cold and you curse\\n\\n“He who cannot be trusted must fall”\\n\\n\\n\\nLoneliness, tenderness, high society, notoriety\\n\\nYou fight for the throne and you travel alone\\n\\nUnknown as you slowly sink\\n\\nAnd there’s no time to think\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the Federal City you been blown and shown pity\\n\\nIn secret, for pieces of change\\n\\nThe empress attracts you but oppression distracts you\\n\\nAnd it makes you feel violent and strange\\n\\n\\n\\nMemory, ecstasy, tyranny, hypocrisy\\n\\nBetrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss\\n\\nIn the valley of the missing link\\n\\nAnd you have no time to think\\n\\n\\n\\nJudges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you\\n\\nHer worst is better than best\\n\\nI’ve seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes\\n\\nAnd I feel so depressed\\n\\n\\n\\nChina doll, alcohol, duality, mortality\\n\\nMercury rules you and destiny fools you\\n\\nLike the plague, with a dangerous wink\\n\\nAnd there’s no time to think\\n\\n\\n\\nYour conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you\\n\\nWhere the lion lies down with the lamb\\n\\nI’d have paid off the traitor and killed him much later\\n\\nBut that’s just the way that I am\\n\\n\\n\\nParadise, sacrifice, mortality, reality\\n\\nBut the magician is quicker and his game\\n\\nIs much thicker than blood and blacker than ink\\n\\nAnd there’s no time to think\\n\\n\\n\\nAnger and jealousy’s all that he sells us\\n\\nHe’s content when you’re under his thumb\\n\\nMadmen oppose him, but your kindness throws him\\n\\nTo survive it you play deaf and dumb\\n\\n\\n\\nEquality, liberty, humility, simplicity\\n\\nYou glance through the mirror and there’s eyes staring clear\\n\\nAt the back of your head as you drink\\n\\nAnd there’s no time to think\\n\\n\\n\\nWarlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow\\n\\nWill offer their heads for a prayer\\n\\nYou can’t find no salvation, you have no expectations\\n\\nAnytime, anyplace, anywhere\\n\\n\\n\\nMercury, gravity, nobility, humility\\n\\nYou know you can’t keep her and the water gets deeper\\n\\nThat is leading you onto the brink\\n\\nBut there’s no time to think\\n\\n\\n\\nYou’ve murdered your vanity, buried your sanity\\n\\nFor pleasure you must now resist\\n\\nLovers obey you but they cannot sway you\\n\\nThey’re not even sure you exist\\n\\n\\n\\nSocialism, hypnotism, patriotism, materialism\\n\\nFools making laws for the breaking of jaws\\n\\nAnd the sound of the keys as they clink\\n\\nBut there’s no time to think\\n\\n\\n\\nThe bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl\\n\\nWith the rose in her hair\\n\\nStarlight in the East and you’re finally released\\n\\nYou’re stranded but with nothing to share\\n\\n\\n\\nLoyalty, unity, epitome, rigidity\\n\\nYou turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille\\n\\n’Neath the moon shinin’ bloody and pink\\n\\nAnd there’s no time to think\\n\\n\\n\\nBullets can harm you and death can disarm you\\n\\nBut no, you will not be deceived\\n\\nStripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt\\n\\nYou can give but you cannot receive\\n\\n\\n\\nNo time to choose when the truth must die\\n\\nNo time to lose or say goodbye\\n\\nNo time to prepare for the victim that’s there\\n\\nNo time to suffer or blink\\n\\nAnd no time to think\\n\\nI’m getting weary looking in my baby’s eyes\\n\\nWhen she’s near me she’s so hard to recognize\\n\\nI finally realize there’s no room for regret\\n\\nTrue love, true love, true love tends to forget\\n\\n\\n\\nHold me, baby be near\\n\\nYou told me that you’d be sincere\\n\\nEvery day of the year’s like playin’ Russian roulette\\n\\nTrue love, true love, true love tends to forget\\n\\n\\n\\nI was lyin’ down in the reeds without any oxygen\\n\\nI saw you in the wilderness among the men\\n\\nSaw you drift into infinity and come back again\\n\\nAll you got to do is wait and I’ll tell you when\\n\\n\\n\\nYou’re a tearjerker, baby, but I’m under your spell\\n\\nYou’re a hard worker, baby, and I know

each other and laugh\\n\\n\\n\\nBut I don’t think it’s liable to happen\\n\\nLike the sound of one hand clappin’\\n\\nThe vows that we kept are now broken and swept\\n\\n’Neath the bed where we slept\\n\\n\\n\\nDon’t think of me and fantasize on what we never had\\n\\nBe grateful for what we’ve shared together and be glad\\n\\nWhy should we go on watching each other through a telescope?\\n\\nEventually we’ll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, babe, time for a new transition\\n\\nI wish I was a magician\\n\\nI would wave a wand and tie back the bond\\n\\nThat we’ve both gone beyond\\n\\nThere’s a long-distance train rolling through the rain\\n\\nTears on the letter I write\\n\\nThere’s a woman I long to touch and I miss her so much\\n\\nBut she’s drifting like a satellite\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s a neon light ablaze in this green smoky haze\\n\\nLaughter down on Elizabeth Street\\n\\nAnd a lonesome bell tone in that valley of stone\\n\\nWhere she bathed in a stream of pure heat\\n\\n\\n\\nHer father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise\\n\\nBut he practiced what he preached from the heart\\n\\nA full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted to me\\n\\nThe time and the place that the trouble would start\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage\\n\\nAnd a longtime golden-haired stripper onstage\\n\\nAnd she winds back the clock and she turns back the page\\n\\nOf a book that no one can write\\n\\nOh, where are you tonight?\\n\\n\\n\\nThe truth was obscure, too profound and too pure\\n\\nTo live it you have to explode\\n\\nIn that last hour of need, we entirely agreed\\n\\nSacrifice was the code of the road\\n\\n\\n\\nI left town at dawn, with Marcel and St. John\\n\\nStrong men belittled by doubt\\n\\nI couldn’t tell her what my private thoughts were\\n\\nBut she had some way of finding them out\\n\\n\\n\\nHe took dead-center aim but he missed just the same\\n\\nShe was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf\\n\\nShe could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair\\n\\nAnd discovered her invisible self\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s a lion in the road, there’s a demon escaped\\n\\nThere’s a million dreams gone, there’s a landscape being raped\\n\\nAs her beauty fades and I watch her undrape\\n\\nI won’t but then again, maybe I might\\n\\nOh, if I could just find you tonight\\n\\n\\n\\nI fought with my twin, that enemy within\\n\\n’Til both of us fell by the way\\n\\nHorseplay and disease is killing me by degrees\\n\\nWhile the law looks the other way\\n\\n\\n\\nYour partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes\\n\\nThe guy you were lovin’ couldn’t stay clean\\n\\nIt felt outa place, my foot in his face\\n\\nBut he should-a stayed where his money was green\\n\\n\\n\\nI bit into the root of forbidden fruit\\n\\nWith the juice running down my leg\\n\\nThen I dealt with your boss, who’d never known about loss\\n\\nAnd who always was too proud to beg\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s a white diamond gloom on the dark side of this room\\n\\nAnd a pathway that leads up to the stars\\n\\nIf you don’t believe there’s a price for this sweet paradise\\n\\nRemind me to show you the scars\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s a new day at dawn and I’ve finally arrived\\n\\nIf I’m there in the morning, baby, you’ll know I’ve survived\\n\\nI can’t believe it, I can’t believe I’m alive\\n\\nBut without you it just doesn’t seem right\\n\\nOh, where are you tonight?\\n\\n\\nSixteen years\\n\\nSixteen banners united over the field\\n\\nWhere the good shepherd grieves\\n\\nDesperate men, desperate women divided\\n\\nSpreading their wings ’neath the falling leaves\\n\\n\\n\\nFortune calls\\n\\nI stepped forth from the shadows, to the marketplace\\n\\nMerchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down\\n\\nShe’s smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born\\n\\nOn midsummer’s eve, near the tower\\n\\n\\n\\nThe cold-blooded moon\\n\\nThe captain waits above the celebration\\n\\nSending his thoughts to a beloved maid\\n\\nWhose ebony face is beyond communication\\n\\nThe captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid\\n\\n\\n\\nThey shaved her head\\n\\nShe was torn between Jupiter and Apollo\\n\\nA messenger arrived with a black nightingale\\n\\nI seen her on the stairs and I couldn’t help but follow\\n\\nFollow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil\\n\\n\\n\\nI stumbled to my feet\\n\\nI rode past destruction in the ditches\\n\\nWith the stitches still mending ’neath a heart-shaped tattoo\\n\\nRenegade priests and treacherous young witches\\n\\nWere handing out the flowers that I’d given to you\\n\\n\\n\\nThe palace of mirrors\\n\\nWhere dog soldiers are reflected\\n\\nThe endless road and the wailing of chimes\\n\\nThe empty rooms where her memory is protected\\n\\nWhere the angels’ voices whisper to the souls of previous times\\n\\n\\n\\nShe wakes him up\\n\\nForty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking\\n\\nNear broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks\\n\\nShe’s begging to know what measures he now will be taking\\n\\nHe’s pulling her down and she’s clutching on to his long golden locks\\n\\n\\n\\nGentlemen, he said\\n\\nI don’t need your organization, I’ve shined your shoes\\n\\nI’ve moved your mountains and marked your cards\\n\\nBut Eden is burning, either brace yourself for elimination\\n\\nOr else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards\\n\\n\\n\\nPeace will come\\n\\nWith tranquillity and splendor on the wheels of fire\\n\\nBut will bring us no reward when her false idols fall\\n\\nAnd cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating\\n\\nBetween the King and the Queen of Swords\\n\\nYou harbor resentment\\n\\nYou know there ain’t too much of a thrill\\n\\nYou wish for contentment\\n\\nBut you got an emptiness that can’t be filled\\n\\nYou’ve had enough of hatred\\n\\nYour bones are breaking, can’t find nothing sacred\\n\\n\\n\\nYe

inside\\n\\nYou know you need a whole new beginning\\n\\nDon’t have to go to Russia or Iran\\n\\nJust surrender to God and He’ll move you right here where you stand, and\\n\\n\\n\\nYe shall be changed, ye shall be changed\\n\\nIn a twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet blows\\n\\nThe dead will arise and burst out of your clothes\\n\\nAnd ye shall be changed\\n\\n\\n\\nYou drink bitter water\\n\\nAnd you been eating the bread of sorrow\\n\\nYou can’t live for today\\n\\nWhen all you’re ever thinking of is tomorrow\\n\\nThe path you’ve endured has been rough\\n\\nWhen you’ve decided

around, baby, we’re not through\\n\\nDon’t look for me, I’ll see you\\n\\nWhen the night comes falling from the sky\\n\\n\\n\\nIn your teardrops, I can see my own reflection\\n\\nIt was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line\\n\\nI don’t want to be a fool starving for affection\\n\\nI don’t want to drown in someone else’s wine\\n\\n\\n\\nFor all eternity I think I will remember\\n\\nThat icy wind that’s howling in your eye\\n\\nYou will seek me and you’ll find me\\n\\nIn the wasteland of your mind\\n\\nWhen the night comes falling from the sky\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I

out of him\\n\\nThat’s what they did\\n\\n\\n\\nHe could’ve sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar\\n\\nCould’ve been an accountant or a tennis star\\n\\n\\n\\nHe was wearing boxing gloves, took a dive one day\\n\\nOff the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay\\n\\n\\n\\nHis mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans\\n\\nThey gotta sleep together in a home they don’t own\\n\\n\\n\\nThey took a clean-cut kid\\n\\nAnd they made a killer out of him\\n\\nThat’s what they did\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, everybody’s asking why he couldn’t adjust\\n\\nAll he ever wanted was somebody to trust\\n\\n\\n\\nThey took his head and turned it inside out\\n\\nHe never did know what it was all about\\n\\n\\n\\nHe had a steady job, he joined the choir\\n\\nHe never did plan to walk the high wire\\n\\n\\n\\nThey took a clean-cut kid\\n\\nAnd they made a killer out of him\\n\\nThat’s what they did\\n\\nWell, I thought that the rain would cool things down\\n\\nBut it looks like it don’t\\n\\nI’d like to get you to change your mind\\n\\nBut it looks like you won’t\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom now on I’ll be busy\\n\\nAin’t goin’ nowhere fast\\n\\nI’m just glad it’s over\\n\\nAnd I’m seeing the real you at last\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, didn’t I risk my neck for you\\n\\nDidn’t I take chances?\\n\\nDidn’t I rise above it all for you\\n\\nThe most unfortunate circumstances?\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I have had some rotten nights\\n\\nDidn’t think that they would pass\\n\\nI’m just thankful and grateful\\n\\nTo be seeing the real you at last\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m hungry and I’m irritable\\n\\nAnd I’m tired of this bag of tricks\\n\\nAt one time there was nothing wrong with me\\n\\nThat you could not fix\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I sailed through the storm\\n\\nStrapped to the mast\\n\\nBut the time has come\\n\\nAnd I’m seeing the real you at last\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I met you, baby\\n\\nYou didn’t show no visible scars\\n\\nYou could ride like Annie Oakley\\n\\nYou could shoot like Belle Starr\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I don’t mind a reasonable amount of trouble\\n\\nTrouble always comes to pass\\n\\nBut all I care about now\\n\\nIs that I’m seeing the real you at last\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I’m gonna quit this baby talk now\\n\\nI guess I should have known\\n\\nI got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles\\n\\nI think maybe we’d better leave each other alone\\n\\n\\n\\nWhatever you gonna do\\n\\nPlease do it fast\\n\\nI’m still trying to get used to\\n\\nSeeing the real you at last\\n\\nWell, I had to move fast\\n\\nAnd I couldn’t with you around my neck\\n\\nI said I’d send for you and I did\\n\\nWhat did you expect?\\n\\nMy hands are sweating\\n\\nAnd we haven’t even started yet\\n\\nI’ll go along with the charade\\n\\nUntil I can think my way out\\n\\nI know it was all a big joke\\n\\nWhatever it was about\\n\\nSomeday maybe\\n\\nI’ll remember to forget\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m gonna get my coat\\n\\nI feel the breath of a storm\\n\\nThere’s something I’ve got to do tonight\\n\\nYou go inside and stay warm\\n\\n\\n\\nHas anybody seen my love\\n\\nHas anybody seen my love\\n\\nHas anybody seen my love\\n\\nI don’t know\\n\\nHas anybody seen my love?\\n\\n\\n\\nYou want to talk to me\\n\\nGo ahead and talk\\n\\nWhatever you got to say to me\\n\\nWon’t come as any shock\\n\\nI must be guilty of something\\n\\nYou just whisper it into my ear\\n\\nMadame Butterfly\\n\\nShe lulled me to sleep\\n\\nIn a town without pity\\n\\nWhere the water runs deep\\n\\nShe said, “Be easy, baby\\n\\nThere ain’t nothin’ worth stealin’ in here”\\n\\n\\n\\nYou’re the one I’ve been looking for\\n\\nYou’re the one that’s got the key\\n\\nBut I can’t figure out whether I’m too good for you\\n\\nOr you’re too good for me\\n\\n\\n\\nHas anybody seen my love\\n\\nHas anybody seen my love\\n\\nHas anybody seen my love\\n\\nI don’t know\\n\\nHas anybody seen my love?\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, they’re not showing any lights tonight\\n\\nAnd there’s no moon\\n\\nThere’s just a hot-blooded singer\\n\\nSinging “Memphis in June”\\n\\nWhile they’re beatin’ the devil out of a guy\\n\\nWho’s wearing a powder-blue wig\\n\\nLater he’ll be shot\\n\\nFor resisting arrest\\n\\nI can still hear his voice crying\\n\\nIn the wilderness\\n\\nWhat looks large from a distance\\n\\nClose up ain’t never that big\\n\\n\\n\\nNever could learn to drink that blood\\n\\nAnd call it wine\\n\\nNever could learn to hold you, love\\n\\nAnd call you mine\\n\\nI’ll remember you\\n\\nWhen I’ve forgotten all the rest\\n\\nYou to me were true\\n\\nYou to me were the best\\n\\nWhen there is no more\\n\\nYou cut to the core\\n\\nQuicker than anyone I knew\\n\\nWhen I’m all alone\\n\\nIn the great unknown\\n\\nI’ll remember you\\n\\n\\n\\nI’ll remember you\\n\\nAt the end of the trail\\n\\nI had so much left to do\\n\\nI had so little time to fail\\n\\nThere’s some people that\\n\\nYou don’t forget\\n\\nEven though you’ve only seen ’m one time or two\\n\\nWhen the roses fade\\n\\nAnd I’m in the shade\\n\\nI’ll remember you\\n\\n\\n\\nDidn’t I, didn’t I try to love you?\\n\\nDidn’t I, didn’t I try to care?\\n\\nDidn’t I sleep, didn’t I weep beside you\\n\\nWith the rain blowing in your hair?\\n\\n\\n\\nI’ll remember you\\n\\nWhen the wind blows through the piney wood\\n\\nIt was you who came right through\\n\\nIt was you who understood\\n\\nThough I’d never say\\n\\nThat I done it the way\\n\\nThat you’d have liked me to\\n\\nIn the end\\n\\nMy dear sweet friend\\n\\nI’ll remember you\\n\\n\\nOh, the gentlemen are talking and the midnight moon is on the riverside\\n\\nThey’re drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide\\n\\nI live in another world where life and death are memorized\\n\\nWhere the earth is strung with lovers’ pearls and all I see are dark eyes\\n\\n\\n\\nA cock is crowing far away and another soldier’s deep in prayer\\n\\nSome mother’s child has gone astray, she can’t find him anywhere\\n\\nBut I can hear another drum beating for the dead that rise\\n\\nWhom nature’s beast fears as they come and all I see are dark eyes\\n\\n\\n\\nThey tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes\\n\\nThey tell me revenge is sweet and from where they stand, I’m sure it is\\n\\nBut I feel nothing for their game where beauty goes unrecognized\\n\\nAll I feel is heat and flame and all I see are dark eyes\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, the French girl, she’s in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel\\n\\nHunger pays a heavy price to the falling gods of speed and steel\\n\\nOh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that flies\\n\\nA million faces at my feet but all I see are dark eyes\\n\\n\\nWell, there was this movie I seen one time\\n\\nAbout a man riding ’cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck\\n\\nHe was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself\\n\\nThe townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, the marshal, now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp\\n\\nAs the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath\\n\\n“Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square\\n\\nI want him to feel what it’s like to every moment face his death”\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in\\n\\nAnd you know it blows right through me like a ball and chain\\n\\nYou know I can’t believe we’ve lived so long and are still so far apart\\n\\nThe memory of you keeps callin’ after me like a rollin’ train\\n\\n\\n\\nI can still see the day that you came to me on the painted desert\\n\\nIn your busted down Ford and your platform heels\\n\\nI could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet\\n\\nAh, but you were right. It was perfect as I got in behind the wheel\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, we drove that car all night into San Anton’\\n\\nAnd we slept near the Alamo, your skin was so tender and soft\\n\\nWay down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back\\n\\nI would have gone on after you but I didn’t feel like letting my head get blown off\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, we’re drivin’ this car and the sun is comin’ up over the Rockies\\n\\nNow I know she ain’t you but she’s here and she’s got that dark rhythm in her soul\\n\\nBut I’m too over the edge and I ain’t in the mood anymore to remember the times\\n\\n    when I was your only man\\n\\nAnd she don’t want to remind me. She knows this car would go out of control\\n\\n\\n\\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls\\n\\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above\\n\\nBrownsville girl, show me all around the world\\n\\nBrownsville girl, you’re my honey love\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo\\n\\nWe pulled up where Henry Porter used to live. He owned a wreckin’ lot\\n\\n    outside of town about a mile\\n\\nRuby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back.\\n\\n    She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust\\n\\nShe said, “Henry ain’t here but you can come on in, he’ll be back in a little while”\\n\\n\\n\\nThen she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinkin’ of\\n\\n    bummin’ a ride back to from where she started\\n\\nBut ya know, she changed the subject every time money came up\\n\\nShe said, “Welcome to the land of the living dead”\\n\\n    You could tell she was so broken hearted\\n\\nShe said, “Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt”\\n\\n\\n\\n“How far are y’all going?” Ruby asked us with a sigh\\n\\n“We’re going all the way ’til the wheels fall off and burn\\n\\n’Til the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies”\\n\\nRuby just smiled and said, “Ah, you know some babies never learn”\\n\\n\\n\\nSomething about that movie though, well I just can’t get it out of my head\\n\\nBut I can’t remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play\\n\\nAll I remember about it was Gregory Peck and the way people moved\\n\\nAnd a lot of them seemed to be lookin’ my way\\n\\n\\n\\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,\\n\\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above\\n\\nBrownsville girl, show me all around the world\\n\\nBrownsville girl, you’re my honey love\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour\\n\\nI was crossin’ the street when shots rang out\\n\\nI didn’t know whether to duck or to run, so I ran\\n\\n“We got him cornered in the churchyard,” I heard somebody shout\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune. Underneath it,\\n\\n    it said, “A man with no alibi”\\n\\nYou went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you\\n\\nThen when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears\\n\\nIt was the best acting I saw anybody do\\n\\n\\n\\nNow I’ve always been the kind of person that doesn’t like to trespass\\n\\n    but sometimes you just find yourself over the line\\n\\nOh if there’s an original thought out there, I could use it right now\\n\\nYou know, I feel pretty good, but that ain’t sayin’ much.\\n\\n    I could feel a whole lot better\\n\\nIf you were just here by my side to show me how\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I’m standin’ in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck\\n\\nYeah, but you know it’s not the one that I had in mind\\n\\nHe’s got a new one out now, I don’t even know what it’s about\\n\\nBut I’ll see him in anything so I’ll stand in line\\n\\n\\n\\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls\\n\\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above\\n\\nBrownsville girl, show me all around the world\\n\\nBrownsville girl, you’re my honey love\\n\\n\\n\\nYou know, it’s funny how things never turn out the way you had ’em planned\\n\\nThe only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter\\n\\n    is that his name wasn’t Henry Porter\\n\\nAnd you know there was somethin’ about you baby that I liked\\n\\n    that was always too good for this world\\n\\nJust like you always said there was somethin’ about me you liked\\n\\n    that I left behind in the French Quarter\\n\\n\\n\\nStrange how people who suffer together have stronger connections\\n\\n    than people who are most content\\n\\nI don’t have any regrets, they can talk about me plenty when I’m gone\\n\\nYou always said people don’t do what they believe in,\\n\\n    they just do what’s most convenient, then they repent\\n\\nAnd I always said, “Hang on to me, baby, and let’s hope that the roof stays on”\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a movie I seen one time, I think I sat through it twice\\n\\nI don’t remember who I was or where I was bound\\n\\nAll I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck, he wore a gun\\n\\n    and he was shot in the back\\n\\nSeems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down\\n\\n\\n\\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls\\n\\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above\\n\\nBrownsville girl, show me all around the world\\n\\nBrownsville girl, you’re my honey love\\n\\nI didn’t know that you’d be leavin’\\n\\nOr who you thought you were talkin’ to\\n\\nI figure maybe we’re even\\n\\nOr maybe I’m one up on you\\n\\n\\n\\nI send you all my money\\n\\nJust like I did before\\n\\nI tried to reach you honey\\n\\nBut you’re driftin’ too far from shore\\n\\n\\n\\nDriftin’ too far from shore\\n\\nDriftin’ too far from shore\\n\\nDriftin’ too far from shore\\n\\nDriftin’ too far from shore\\n\\n\\n\\nI ain’t gonna get lost in this current\\n\\nI don’t like playing cat and mouse\\n\\nNo gentleman likes making love to a servant\\n\\nEspecially when he’s in his father’s house\\n\\n\\n\\nI never could guess your weight, baby\\n\\nNever needed to call you my whore\\n\\nI always thought you were straight, baby\\n\\nBut you’re driftin’ too far from shore\\n\\n\\n\\nDriftin’ too far from shore\\n\\nDriftin’ too far from shore\\n\\nDriftin’ too far from shore\\n\\nDriftin’ too far from shore\\n\\n\\n\\nWell these times and these tunnels are haunted\\n\\nThe bottom of the barrel is too\\n\\nI waited years sometimes for what I wanted\\n\\nEverybody can’t be as lucky as you\\n\\n\\n\\nNever no more do I wonder\\n\\nWhy you don’t never play with me anymore\\n\\nAt any moment you could go under\\n\\n’Cause you’re driftin’ too far from shore\\n\\n\\n\\nDriftin’ too far from shore\\n\\nDriftin’ too far from shore\\n\\nDriftin’ too far from shore\\n\\nDriftin’ too far from shore\\n\\n\\n\\nYou and me we had completeness\\n\\nI give you all of what I could provide\\n\\nWe weren’t on the wrong side, sweetness\\n\\nWe were the wrong side\\n\\n\\n\\nI’ve already ripped out the phones, honey\\n\\nYou can’t walk the streets in a war\\n\\nI can finish this alone honey\\n\\nYou’re driftin’ too far from shore\\n\\n\\nWhen you’re sad and when you’re lonely\\n\\nAnd you haven’t got a friend\\n\\nJust remember that death is not the end\\n\\nAnd all that you’ve held sacred\\n\\nFalls down and does not mend\\n\\nJust remember that death is not the end\\n\\nNot the end, not the end\\n\\nJust remember that death is not the end\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen you’re standing at the crossroads\\n\\nThat you cannot comprehend\\n\\nJust remember that death is not the end\\n\\nAnd all your dreams have vanished\\n\\nAnd you don’t know what’s up the bend\\n\\nJust remember that death is not the end\\n\\nNot the end, not the end\\n\\nJust remember that death is not the end\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the storm clouds gather ’round you\\n\\nAnd heavy rains descend\\n\\nJust remember that death is not the end\\n\\nAnd there’s no one there to comfort you\\n\\nWith a helpin’ hand to lend\\n\\nJust remember that death is not the end\\n\\nNot the end, not the end\\n\\nJust remember that death is not the end\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, the tree of life is growing\\n\\nWhere the spirit never dies\\n\\nAnd the bright light of salvation shines\\n\\nIn dark and empty skies\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the cities are on fire\\n\\nWith the burning flesh of men\\n\\nJust remember that death is not the end\\n\\nAnd you search in vain to find\\n\\nJust one law-abiding citizen\\n\\nJust remember that death is not the end\\n\\nNot the end, not the end\\n\\nJust remember that death is not the end\\n\\nI got to see you baby, I don’t care\\n\\nIt may be someplace, baby, you say where\\n\\n\\n\\nI had a dream about you, baby\\n\\nHad a dream about you, baby\\n\\nLate last night you come a-rollin’ across my mind\\n\\n\\n\\nYou got the crazy rhythm when you walk\\n\\nYou make me nervous when you start to talk\\n\\n\\n\\nI had a dream about you, baby\\n\\nHad a dream about you, baby\\n\\nLate last night you come a-rollin’ across my mind\\n\\n\\n\\nStandin’ on the highway, you flag me down\\n\\nSaid, take me Daddy, to the nearest town\\n\\n\\n\\nI had a dream about you, baby\\n\\nHad a dream about you, baby\\n\\nLate last night you come a-rollin’ across my mind\\n\\n\\n\\nThe joint is jumpin’\\n\\nIt’s really somethin’\\n\\nThe beat is pumpin’\\n\\nMy heart is thumpin’\\n\\nSpent my money on you honey\\n\\nMy limbs are shakin’\\n\\nMy heart is breakin’\\n\\n\\n\\nYou kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop\\n\\nYou make me nervous, you gotta stop\\n\\n\\n\\nI had a dream about you, baby\\n\\nHad a dream about you, baby\\n\\nLate last night you come a-rollin’ across my mind\\n\\n\\n\\nYou got a rag wrapped around your head\\n\\nWearing a long dress fire engine red\\n\\n\\n\\nI had a dream about you, baby\\n\\nHad a dream about you, baby\\n\\nLate last night you come a-rollin’ across my mind\\n\\nStake my future on a hell of a past\\n\\nLooks like tomorrow is coming on fast\\n\\nAin\\'t complaining \\'bout what I got\\n\\nSeen better times, but who has not?\\n\\n\\n\\nSilvio\\n\\nSilver and gold\\n\\nWon\\'t buy back the beat of a heart grown cold\\n\\nSilvio\\n\\nI gotta go\\n\\nFind out something only dead men know\\n\\n\\n\\nHonest as the next jade rolling that stone\\n\\nWhen I come knocking don\\'t throw me no bone\\n\\nI\\'m an old boll weevil looking for a home\\n\\nIf you don\\'t like it you can leave me alone\\n\\n\\n\\nI can snap my fingers and require the rain\\n\\nFrom a clear blue sky and turn it off again\\n\\nI can stroke your body and relieve your pain\\n\\nAnd charm the whistle off an evening train\\n\\n\\n\\nI give what I got until I got no more\\n\\nI take what I get until I even the score\\n\\nYou know I love you and furthermore\\n\\nWhen it\\'s time to go you got an open door\\n\\n\\n\\nI can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain\\n\\nYou give something up for everything you gain\\n\\nSince every pleasure\\'s got an edge of pain\\n\\nPay for your ticket and don\\'t complain\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of these days and it won\\'t be long\\n\\nGoing down in the valley and sing my song\\n\\nI will sing it loud and sing it strong\\n\\nLet the echo decide if I was right or wrong\\n\\n\\n\\nSilvio\\n\\nSilver and gold\\n\\nWon\\'t buy back the beat of a heart grown cold\\n\\nSilvio\\n\\nI gotta go\\n\\nFind out something

dreams\\n\\nRing them bells from the sanctuaries\\n\\n’Cross the valleys and streams\\n\\nFor they’re deep and they’re wide\\n\\nAnd the world’s on its side\\n\\nAnd time is running backwards\\n\\nAnd so is the bride\\n\\n\\n\\nRing them bells St. Peter\\n\\nWhere the four winds blow\\n\\nRing them bells with an iron hand\\n\\nSo the people will know\\n\\nOh it’s rush hour now\\n\\nOn the wheel and the plow\\n\\nAnd the sun is going down\\n\\nUpon the sacred cow\\n\\n\\n\\nRing them bells Sweet Martha\\n\\nFor the poor man’s son\\n\\nRing them bells so the world will know\\n\\nThat God is one\\n\\nOh the shepherd is asleep\\n\\nWhere the willows weep\\n\\nAnd the mountains are filled\\n\\nWith lost sheep\\n\\n\\n\\nRing them bells for the blind and the deaf\\n\\nRing them bells for all of us who are left\\n\\nRing them bells for the chosen few\\n\\nWho will judge the many when the game is through\\n\\nRing them bells, for the time that flies\\n\\nFor the child that cries\\n\\nWhen innocence dies\\n\\n\\n\\nRing them bells St. Catherine\\n\\nFrom the top of the room\\n\\nRing them from the fortress\\n\\nFor the lilies that bloom\\n\\nOh the lines are long\\n\\nAnd the fighting is strong\\n\\nAnd they’re breaking down the distance\\n\\nBetween right and wrong\\n\\n\\nCrickets are chirpin’, the water is high\\n\\nThere’s a soft cotton dress on the line hangin’ dry\\n\\nWindow wide open, African trees\\n\\nBent over backwards from a hurricane breeze\\n\\nNot a word of goodbye, not even a note\\n\\nShe gone with the man\\n\\nIn the long black coat\\n\\n\\n\\nSomebody seen him hanging around\\n\\nAt the old dance hall on the outskirts of town\\n\\nHe looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask\\n\\nIf he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask\\n\\nSomebody said from the Bible he’d quote\\n\\nThere was dust on the man\\n\\nIn the long black coat\\n\\n\\n\\nPreacher was a talkin’, there’s a sermon he gave\\n\\nHe said \"Every man’s conscience is vile and depraved\\n\\nYou cannot depend on it to be your guide\\n\\nWhen it’s you who must keep it satisfied.\"\\n\\nIt ain’t easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat\\n\\nShe gave her heart to the man\\n\\nIn the long black coat\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are no mistakes in life some people say\\n\\nAnd it\\'s true sometimes you can see it that way\\n\\nI went down to the river but I just missed the boat\\n\\nShe went with the man\\n\\nIn the long black coat\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s smoke on the water, it’s been there since June\\n\\nTree trunks uprooted, \\'neath the high crescent moon\\n\\nFeel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force\\n\\nSomebody is out there beating a dead horse\\n\\nShe never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote\\n\\nShe went with the man\\n\\nIn the long black coat\\n\\n\\nI was thinking of a series of dreams\\n\\nWhere nothing comes up to the top\\n\\nEverything stays down where it’s wounded\\n\\nAnd comes to a permanent stop\\n\\nWasn’t thinking of anything specific\\n\\nLike in a dream, when someone wakes up and screams\\n\\nNothing too very scientific\\n\\nJust thinking of a series of dreams\\n\\n\\n\\nThinking of a series of dreams\\n\\nWhere the time and the tempo fly\\n\\nAnd there’s no exit in any direction\\n\\n’Cept the one that you can’t see with your eyes\\n\\nWasn’t making any great connection\\n\\nWasn’t falling for any intricate scheme\\n\\nNothing that would pass inspection\\n\\nJust thinking of a series of dreams\\n\\n\\n\\nDreams where the umbrella is folded\\n\\nInto the path you are hurled\\n\\nAnd the cards are no good that you’re holding\\n\\nUnless they’re from another world\\n\\n\\n\\nIn one, numbers were burning\\n\\nIn another, I witnessed a crime\\n\\nIn one, I was running, and in another\\n\\nAll I seemed to be doing was climb\\n\\nWasn’t looking for any special assistance\\n\\nNot going to any great extremes\\n\\nI’d already gone the distance\\n\\nJust thinking of a series of dreams\\n\\nWe live in a political world\\n\\nLove don’t have any place\\n\\nWe’re living in times where men commit crimes\\n\\nAnd crime don’t have a face\\n\\n\\n\\nWe live in a political world\\n\\nIcicles hanging down\\n\\nWedding bells ring and angels sing\\n\\nClouds cover up the ground\\n\\n\\n\\nWe live in a political world\\n\\nWisdom is thrown into jail\\n\\nIt rots in a cell, is misguided as hell\\n\\nLeaving no one to pick up a trail\\n\\n\\n\\nWe live in a political world\\n\\nWhere mercy walks the plank\\n\\nLife is in mirrors, death disappears\\n\\nUp the steps into the nearest bank\\n\\n\\n\\nWe live in a political world\\n\\nWhere courage is a thing of the past\\n\\nHouses are haunted, children are unwanted\\n\\nThe next day could be your last\\n\\n\\n\\nWe live in a political world\\n\\nThe one we can see and can feel\\n\\nBut there’s no one to check, it’s all a stacked deck\\n\\nWe all know for sure that it’s real\\n\\n\\n\\nWe live in a political world\\n\\nIn the cities of lonesome fear\\n\\nLittle by little you turn in the middle\\n\\nBut you’re never sure why you’re here\\n\\n\\n\\nWe live in a political world\\n\\nUnder the microscope\\n\\nYou can travel anywhere and hang yourself there\\n\\nYou always got more than enough rope\\n\\n\\n\\nWe live in a political world\\n\\nTurning and a-thrashing about\\n\\nAs soon as you’re awake, you’re trained to take\\n\\nWhat looks like the easy way out\\n\\n\\n\\nWe live in a political world\\n\\nWhere peace is not welcome at all\\n\\nIt’s turned away from the door to wander some more\\n\\nOr put up against the wall\\n\\n\\n\\nWe live in a political world\\n\\nEverything is hers or his\\n\\nClimb into the frame and shout God’s name\\n\\nBut you’re never sure what it is\\n\\n\\nFar away where the soft winds blow\\n\\nFar away from it all\\n\\nThere is a place you go\\n\\nWhere teardrops fall\\n\\n\\n\\nFar away in the stormy night\\n\\nFar away and over the wall\\n\\nYou are there in the flickering light\\n\\nWhere teardrops fall\\n\\n\\n\\nWe banged the drum slowly\\n\\nAnd played the fife lowly\\n\\nYou know the song in my heart\\n\\nIn the turning of twilight\\n\\nIn the shadows of moonlight\\n\\nYou can show me a new place to start\\n\\n\\n\\nI’ve torn my clothes and I’ve drained the cup\\n\\nStrippin’ away at it all\\n\\nThinking of you when the sun comes up\\n\\nWhere teardrops fall\\n\\n\\n\\nBy rivers of blindness\\n\\nIn love and with kindness\\n\\nWe could hold up a toast if we meet\\n\\nTo the cuttin’ of fences\\n\\nTo sharpen the senses\\n\\nThat linger in the fireball heat\\n\\n\\n\\nRoses are red, violets are blue\\n\\nAnd time is beginning to crawl\\n\\nI just might have to come see you\\n\\nWhere teardrops fall\\n\\nWhat good am I if I’m like all the rest\\n\\nIf I just turn away, when I see how you’re dressed\\n\\nIf I shut myself off so I can’t hear you cry\\n\\nWhat good am I?\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat good am I if I know and don’t do\\n\\nIf I see and don’t say, if I look right through you\\n\\nIf I turn a deaf ear to the thunderin’ sky\\n\\nWhat good am I?\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat good am I while you softly weep\\n\\nAnd I hear in my head what you say in your sleep\\n\\nAnd I freeze in the moment like the rest who don’t try\\n\\nWhat good am I?\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat good am I then to others and me\\n\\nIf I’ve had every chance and yet still fail to see\\n\\nIf my hands are tied must I not wonder within\\n\\nWho tied them and why and where must I have been?\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat good am I if I say foolish things\\n\\nAnd I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings\\n\\nAnd I just turn my back while you silently die\\n\\nWhat good am I?\\n\\n\\nMost of the time\\n\\nI’m clear focused all around\\n\\nMost of the time\\n\\nI can keep both feet on the ground\\n\\nI can follow the path, I can read the signs\\n\\nStay right with it when the road unwinds\\n\\nI can handle whatever I stumble upon\\n\\nI don’t even notice she’s gone\\n\\nMost of the time\\n\\n\\n\\nMost of the time\\n\\nIt’s well understood\\n\\nMost of the time\\n\\nI wouldn’t change it if I could\\n\\nI can make it all match up, I can hold my own\\n\\nI can deal with the situation right down to the bone\\n\\nI can survive, I can endure\\n\\nAnd I don’t even think about her\\n\\nMost of the time\\n\\n\\n\\nMost of the time\\n\\nMy head is on straight\\n\\nMost of the time\\n\\nI’m strong enough not to hate\\n\\nI don’t build up illusion ’til it makes me sick\\n\\nI ain’t afraid of confusion no matter how thick\\n\\nI can smile in the face of mankind\\n\\nDon’t even remember what her lips felt like on mine\\n\\nMost of the time\\n\\n\\n\\nMost of the time\\n\\nShe ain’t even in my mind\\n\\nI wouldn’t know her if I saw her\\n\\nShe’s that far behind\\n\\nMost of the time\\n\\nI can’t even be sure\\n\\nIf she was ever with me\\n\\nOr if I was with her\\n\\n\\n\\nMost of the time\\n\\nI’m halfway content\\n\\nMost of the time\\n\\nI know exactly where it went\\n\\nI don’t cheat on myself, I don’t run and hide\\n\\nHide from the feelings that are buried inside\\n\\nI don’t compromise and I don’t pretend\\n\\nI don’t even care if I ever see her again\\n\\nMost of the time\\n\\nBroken lines, broken strings\\n\\nBroken threads, broken springs\\n\\nBroken idols, broken heads\\n\\nPeople sleeping in broken beds\\n\\nAin’t no use jiving, ain’t no use joking\\n\\nEverything is broken\\n\\n\\n\\nBroken bottles, broken plates\\n\\nBroken switches, broken gates\\n\\nBroken dishes, broken parts\\n\\nStreets are filled with broken

you wanted\\n\\nWhat could it be\\n\\nDid somebody tell you\\n\\nThat you could get it from me\\n\\nIs it something that comes natural\\n\\nIs it easy to say\\n\\nWhy do you want it\\n\\nWho are you anyway?\\n\\n\\n\\nIs the scenery changing\\n\\nAm I getting it wrong\\n\\nIs the whole thing going backwards\\n\\nAre they playing our song?\\n\\nWhere were you when it started\\n\\nDo you want it for free\\n\\nWhat was it you wanted\\n\\nAre you talking to me?\\n\\nSeen a shooting star tonight\\n\\nAnd I thought of you\\n\\nYou were trying to break into another world\\n\\nA world I never knew\\n\\nI always kind of wondered\\n\\nIf you ever made it through\\n\\nSeen a shooting star tonight\\n\\nAnd I thought of you\\n\\n\\n\\nSeen a shooting star tonight\\n\\nAnd I thought of me\\n\\nIf I was still the same\\n\\nIf I ever became what you wanted me to be\\n\\nDid I miss the mark or overstep the line\\n\\nThat only you could see?\\n\\nSeen a shooting star tonight\\n\\nAnd I thought of me\\n\\n\\n\\nListen to the engine, listen to the bell\\n\\nAs the last fire truck from hell\\n\\nGoes rolling by\\n\\nAll good people are praying\\n\\nIt’s the last temptation, the last account\\n\\nThe last time you might hear the sermon on the mount\\n\\nThe last radio is playing\\n\\n\\n\\nSeen a shooting star tonight\\n\\nSlip away\\n\\nTomorrow will be\\n\\nAnother day\\n\\nGuess it’s too late to say the things to you\\n\\nThat you needed to hear me say\\n\\nSeen a shooting star tonight\\n\\nSlip away\\n\\n\\nOne time in London I’d gone out for a walk\\n\\nPast a place called Hyde Park where people talk\\n\\n’Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view\\n\\nTo anyone passing by, that’s who they’re talking to\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was someone on a platform talking to the folks\\n\\nAbout the T.V. god and all the pain that it invokes\\n\\n“It’s too bright a light,” he said, “for anybody’s eyes\\n\\nIf you’ve never seen one it’s a blessing in disguise”\\n\\n\\n\\nI moved in closer, got up on my toes\\n\\nTwo men in front of me were coming to blows\\n\\nThe man was saying something ’bout children when they’re young\\n\\nBeing sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung\\n\\n\\n\\n“The news of the day is on all the time\\n\\nAll the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme\\n\\nYour mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free\\n\\nDon’t let an egg get laid in it by something you can’t see”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Pray for peace!” he said. You could feel it in the crowd\\n\\nMy thoughts began to wander. His voice was ringing loud\\n\\n“It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone\\n\\nNo one can protect you from it once you turn it on”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It will lead you into some strange pursuits\\n\\nLead you to the land of forbidden fruits\\n\\nIt will scramble up your head and drag your brain about\\n\\nSometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s all been designed,” he said, “to make you lose your mind\\n\\nAnd when you go back to find it, there’s nothing there to find\\n\\nEvery time you look at it, your situation’s worse\\n\\nIf you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe crowd began to riot and they grabbed hold of the man\\n\\nThere was pushing, there was shoving and everybody ran\\n\\nThe T.V. crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me\\n\\nLater on that evening, I watched it on T.V.\\n\\n\\nThere was a little boy and there was a little girl\\n\\nAnd they lived in an alley under the red sky\\n\\nThere was a little boy and there was a little girl\\n\\nAnd they lived in an alley under the red sky\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was an old man and he lived in the moon\\n\\nOne summer’s day he came passing by\\n\\nThere was an old man and he lived in the moon\\n\\nAnd one day he came passing by\\n\\n\\n\\nSomeday little girl, everything for you is gonna be new\\n\\nSomeday little girl, you’ll have a diamond as big as your shoe\\n\\n\\n\\nLet the wind blow low, let the wind blow high\\n\\nOne day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie\\n\\nLet the wind blow low, let the wind blow high\\n\\nOne day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is the key to the kingdom and this is the town\\n\\nThis is the blind horse that leads you around\\n\\n\\n\\nLet the bird sing, let the bird fly\\n\\nOne day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry\\n\\nLet the bird sing, let the bird fly\\n\\nThe man in the moon went home and the river went dry\\n\\n\\nIt’s unbelievable, it’s strange but true\\n\\nIt’s inconceivable it could happen to you\\n\\nYou go north and you go south\\n\\nJust like bait in the fish’s mouth\\n\\nYa must be livin’ in the shadow of some kind of evil star\\n\\nIt’s unbelievable it would get this far\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s undeniable what they’d have you to think\\n\\nIt’s indescribable, it can drive you to drink\\n\\nThey said it was the land of milk and honey\\n\\nNow they say it’s the land of money\\n\\nWho ever thought they could ever make that stick\\n\\nIt’s unbelievable you can get this rich this quick\\n\\n\\n\\nEvery head is so dignified\\n\\nEvery moon is so sanctified\\n\\nEvery urge is so satisfied as long as you’re with me\\n\\nAll the silver, all the gold\\n\\nAll the sweethearts you can hold\\n\\nThat don’t come back with stories untold\\n\\nAre hanging on a tree\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s unbelievable like a lead balloon\\n\\nIt’s so impossible to even learn the tune\\n\\nKill that beast and feed that swine\\n\\nScale that wall and smoke that vine\\n\\nFeed that horse and saddle up the drum\\n\\nIt’s unbelievable, the day would finally come\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce there was a man who had no eyes\\n\\nEvery lady in the land told him lies\\n\\nHe stood beneath the silver sky and his heart began to bleed\\n\\nEvery brain is civilized\\n\\nEvery nerve is analyzed\\n\\nEverything is criticized when you are in need\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s unbelievable, it’s fancy-free\\n\\nSo interchangeable, so delightful to see\\n\\nTurn your back, wash your hands\\n\\nThere’s always someone who understands\\n\\nIt don’t matter no more what you got to say\\n\\nIt’s unbelievable it would go down this way\\n\\n\\nTen thousand men on a hill\\n\\nTen thousand men on a hill\\n\\nSome of ’m goin’ down, some of ’m gonna get killed\\n\\n\\n\\nTen thousand men dressed in oxford blue\\n\\nTen thousand men dressed in oxford blue\\n\\nDrummin’ in the morning, in the evening they’ll be coming for you\\n\\n\\n\\nTen thousand men on the move\\n\\nTen thousand men on the move\\n\\nNone of them doing nothin’ that your mama wouldn’t disapprove\\n\\n\\n\\nTen thousand men digging for silver and gold\\n\\nTen thousand men digging for silver and gold\\n\\nAll clean shaven, all coming in from the cold\\n\\n\\n\\nHey!

dignity\\n\\n\\n\\nSick man lookin’ for the doctor’s cure\\n\\nLookin’ at his hands for the lines that were\\n\\nAnd into every masterpiece of literature\\n\\nFor dignity\\n\\n\\n\\nEnglishman stranded in the blackheart wind\\n\\nCombin’ his hair back, his future looks thin\\n\\nBites the bullet and he looks within\\n\\nFor dignity\\n\\n\\n\\nSomeone showed me a picture and I just laughed\\n\\nDignity never been photographed\\n\\nI went into the red, went into the black\\n\\nInto the valley of dry bone dreams\\n\\n\\n\\nSo many roads, so much at stake\\n\\nSo many dead ends, I’m at the edge of the lake\\n\\nSometimes I wonder what it’s gonna take\\n\\nTo find dignity\\n\\nShadows are falling and I’ve been here all day\\n\\nIt’s too hot to sleep, time is running away\\n\\nFeel like my soul has turned into steel\\n\\nI’ve still got the scars that the sun didn’t heal\\n\\nThere’s not even room enough to be anywhere\\n\\nIt’s not dark yet, but it’s getting there\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain\\n\\nBehind every beautiful thing there’s been some kind of pain\\n\\nShe wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind\\n\\nShe put down in writing what was in her mind\\n\\nI just don’t see why I should even care\\n\\nIt’s not dark yet, but it’s getting there\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I’ve been to London and I’ve been to gay Paree\\n\\nI’ve followed the river and I got to the sea\\n\\nI’ve been down on the bottom of a world full of lies\\n\\nI ain’t looking for nothing in anyone’s eyes\\n\\nSometimes my burden seems more than I can bear\\n\\nIt’s not dark yet, but it’s getting there\\n\\n\\n\\nI was born here and I’ll die here against my will\\n\\nI know it looks like I’m moving, but I’m standing still\\n\\nEvery nerve in my body is so vacant and numb\\n\\nI can’t even remember what it was I came here to get away from\\n\\nDon’t even hear a murmur of a prayer\\n\\nIt’s not dark yet, but it’s getting there\\n\\nI’m walking through the summer nights\\n\\nJukebox playing low\\n\\nYesterday everything was going too fast\\n\\nToday, it’s moving too slow\\n\\nI got no place left to turn\\n\\nI got nothing left to burn\\n\\nDon’t know if I saw you, if I would kiss you or kill you\\n\\nIt probably wouldn’t matter to you anyhow\\n\\nYou left me standing in the doorway crying\\n\\nI got nothing to go back to now\\n\\n\\n\\nThe light in this place is so bad\\n\\nMaking me sick in the head\\n\\nAll the laughter is just making me sad\\n\\nThe stars have turned cherry red\\n\\nI’m strumming on my gay guitar\\n\\nSmoking a cheap cigar\\n\\nThe ghost of our old love has not gone away\\n\\nDon’t look like it will anytime soon\\n\\nYou left me standing in the doorway crying\\n\\nUnder the midnight moon\\n\\n\\n\\nMaybe they’ll get me and maybe they won’t\\n\\nBut not tonight and it won’t be here\\n\\nThere are things I could say but I don’t\\n\\nI know the mercy of God must be near\\n\\nI’ve been riding the midnight train\\n\\nGot ice water in my veins\\n\\nI would be crazy if I took you back\\n\\nIt would go up against every rule\\n\\nYou left me standing in the doorway crying\\n\\nSuffering like a fool\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the last rays of daylight go down\\n\\nBuddy, you’ll roll no more\\n\\nI can hear the church bells ringing in the yard\\n\\nI wonder who they’re ringing for\\n\\nI know I can’t win\\n\\nBut my heart just won’t give in\\n\\nLast night I danced with a stranger\\n\\nBut she just reminded me you were the one\\n\\nYou left me standing in the doorway crying\\n\\nIn the dark land of the sun\\n\\n\\n\\nI’ll eat when I’m hungry, drink when I’m dry\\n\\nAnd live my life on the square\\n\\nAnd even if the flesh falls off of my face\\n\\nI know someone will be there to care\\n\\nIt always means so much\\n\\nEven the softest touch\\n\\nI see nothing to be gained by any explanation\\n\\nThere are no words that need to be said\\n\\nYou left me standing in the doorway crying\\n\\nBlues wrapped around my head\\n\\n\\nYou took a part of me that I really miss\\n\\nI keep asking myself how long it can go on like this\\n\\nYou told yourself a lie, that’s all right mama I told myself one too\\n\\nI’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you\\n\\n\\n\\nYou took the silver, you took the gold\\n\\nYou left me standing out in the cold\\n\\nPeople ask about you, I didn’t tell them everything I knew\\n\\nWell, I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m drifting in and out of dreamless sleep\\n\\nThrowing all my memories in a ditch so deep\\n\\nDid so many things I never did intend to do\\n\\nWell, I’m tryin’ to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you\\n\\n\\n\\nI need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low\\n\\nI need every bit of it for the places that I go\\n\\nSometimes I wonder just what it’s all coming to\\n\\nWell, I’m tryin’ to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I don’t dare close my eyes and I don’t dare wink\\n\\nMaybe in the next life I’ll be able to hear myself think\\n\\nFeel like talking to somebody but I just don’t know who\\n\\nWell, I’m tryin’ to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you\\n\\n\\n\\nThe last thing you said before you hit the street\\n\\n“Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet”\\n\\nI said, “That’s all right, you do what you gotta do”\\n\\nWell, I’m tryin’ to get closer, I’m still a million miles from you\\n\\n\\n\\nRock me, pretty baby, rock me ’til everything gets real\\n\\nRock me for a little while, rock me ’til there’s nothing left to feel\\n\\nAnd I’ll rock you too\\n\\nI’m tryin’ to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, there’s voices in the night trying to be heard\\n\\nI’m sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word\\n\\nI know plenty of people who would put me up for a day or two\\n\\nYes, I’m tryin’ to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you\\n\\n\\nThe air is getting hotter\\n\\nThere’s a rumbling in the skies\\n\\nI’ve been wading through the high muddy water\\n\\nWith the heat rising in my eyes\\n\\nEvery day your memory grows dimmer\\n\\nIt doesn’t haunt me like it did before\\n\\nI’ve been walking through the middle of nowhere\\n\\nTrying to get to heaven before they close the door\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I was in Missouri\\n\\nThey would not let me be\\n\\nI had to leave there in a hurry\\n\\nI only saw what they let me see\\n\\nYou broke a heart that loved you\\n\\nNow you can seal up the book and not write anymore\\n\\nI’ve been walking that lonesome valley\\n\\nTrying to get to heaven before they close the door\\n\\n\\n\\nPeople on the platforms\\n\\nWaiting for the trains\\n\\nI can hear their hearts a-beatin’\\n\\nLike pendulums swinging on chains\\n\\nI tried to give you everything\\n\\nThat your heart was longing for\\n\\nI’m just going down the road feeling bad\\n\\nTrying to get to heaven before they close the door\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m going down the river\\n\\nDown to New Orleans\\n\\nThey tell me everything is gonna be all right\\n\\nBut I don’t know what “all right” even means\\n\\nI was riding in a buggy with Miss Mary-Jane\\n\\nMiss Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore\\n\\nI been all around the world, boys\\n\\nNow I’m trying to get to heaven before they close the door\\n\\n\\n\\nGonna sleep down in the parlor\\n\\nAnd relive my dreams\\n\\nI’ll close my eyes and I wonder\\n\\nIf everything is as hollow as it seems\\n\\nWhen you think that you’ve lost everything\\n\\nYou find out you can always lose a little more\\n\\nI been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down\\n\\nNow I’m trying to get to heaven before they close the door\\n\\nWell, my nerves are exploding and my body’s tense\\n\\nI feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence\\n\\nI’ve been hit too hard, I’ve seen too much\\n\\nNothing can heal me now, but your touch\\n\\nI don’t know what I’m gonna do\\n\\nI was all right ’til I fell in love with you\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, my house is on fire, burning to the sky\\n\\nI thought it would rain but the clouds passed by\\n\\nNow I feel like I’m coming to the end of my way\\n\\nBut I know God is my shield and he won’t lead me astray\\n\\nStill I don’t know what I’m gonna do\\n\\nI was all right ’til I fell in love with you\\n\\n\\n\\nBoys in the street beginning to play\\n\\nGirls like birds flying away\\n\\nWhen I’m gone you will remember my name\\n\\nI’m gonna win my way to wealth and fame\\n\\nI don’t know what I’m gonna do\\n\\nI was all right ’til I fell in love with you\\n\\n\\n\\nJunk is piling up, taking up space\\n\\nMy eyes feel like they’re falling off my face\\n\\nSweat falling down, I’m staring at the floor\\n\\nI’m thinking about that girl who won’t be back no more\\n\\nI don’t know what I’m gonna do\\n\\nI was all right ’til I fell in love with you\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I’m tired of talking, I’m tired of trying to explain\\n\\nMy attempts to please you were all in vain\\n\\nTomorrow night before the sun goes down\\n\\nIf I’m still among the living, I’ll be Dixie bound\\n\\nI just don’t know what I’m gonna do\\n\\nI was all right ’til I fell in love with you\\n\\n\\nI can’t wait, wait for you to change your mind\\n\\nIt’s late, I’m trying to walk the line\\n\\nWell, it’s way past midnight and there are people all around\\n\\nSome on their way up, some on their way down\\n\\nThe air burns and I’m trying to think straight\\n\\nAnd I don’t know how much longer I can wait\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m your man, I’m trying to recover the sweet love that we knew\\n\\nYou understand that my heart can’t go on beating without you\\n\\nWell, your loveliness has wounded me, I’m reeling from the blow\\n\\nI wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so\\n\\nI’m breathing hard, standing at the gate\\n\\nBut I don’t know how much longer I can wait\\n\\n\\n\\nSkies are grey, I’m looking for anything that will bring a happy glow\\n\\nNight or day, it doesn’t matter where I go anymore, I just go\\n\\nIf I ever saw you coming I don’t know what I would do\\n\\nI’d like to think I could control myself, but it isn’t true\\n\\nThat’s how it is when things disintegrate\\n\\nAnd I don’t know how much longer I can wait\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m doomed to love you, I’ve been rolling through stormy weather\\n\\nI’m thinking of you and all the places we could roam together\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s mighty funny, the end of time has just begun\\n\\nOh, honey, after all these years you’re still the one\\n\\nWhile I’m strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind\\n\\nI left my life with you somewhere back there along the line\\n\\nI thought somehow that I would be spared this fate\\n\\nBut I don’t know how much longer I can wait\\n\\n\\nWell my heart’s in the Highlands, gentle and fair\\n\\nHoneysuckle blooming in the wildwood air\\n\\nBluebelles blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow\\n\\nWell my heart’s in the Highland\\n\\nI’m gonna go there when I feel good enough to go\\n\\n\\n\\nWindows were shakin’ all night in my dreams\\n\\nEverything was exactly the way that it seems\\n\\nWoke up this morning and I looked at the same old page\\n\\nSame ol’ rat race\\n\\nLife in the same ol’ cage\\n\\n\\n\\nI don’t want nothing from anyone, ain’t that much to take\\n\\nWouldn’t know the difference between a real blonde and a fake\\n\\nFeel like a prisoner in a world of mystery\\n\\nI wish someone would come\\n\\nAnd push back the clock for me\\n\\n\\n\\nWell my heart’s in the Highlands wherever I roam\\n\\nThat’s where I’ll be when I get called home\\n\\nThe wind, it whispers to the buckeyed trees in rhyme\\n\\nWell my heart’s in the Highlands\\n\\nI can only get there one step at a time\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound\\n\\nSomeone’s always yelling turn it down\\n\\nFeel like I’m drifting\\n\\nDrifting from scene to scene\\n\\nI’m wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean?\\n\\n\\n\\nInsanity is smashing up against my soul\\n\\nYou can say I was on anything but a roll\\n\\nIf I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top\\n\\nWhat would I do with it anyway\\n\\nMaybe take it to the pawn shop\\n\\n\\n\\nMy heart’s in the Highlands at the break of dawn\\n\\nBy the beautiful lake of the Black Swan\\n\\nBig white clouds like chariots that swing down low\\n\\nWell my heart’s in the Highlands\\n\\nOnly place left to go\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m in Boston town, in some restaurant\\n\\nI got no idea what I want\\n\\nWell, maybe I do but I’m just really not sure\\n\\nWaitress comes over\\n\\nNobody in the place but me and her\\n\\n\\n\\nIt must be a holiday, there’s nobody around\\n\\nShe studies me closely as I sit down\\n\\nShe got a pretty face and long white shiny legs\\n\\nShe says, “What’ll it be?”\\n\\nI say, “I don’t know, you got any soft boiled eggs?”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe looks at me, says, “I’d bring you some\\n\\nBut we’re out of ’m, you picked the wrong time to come”\\n\\nThen she says, “I know you’re an artist, draw a picture of me!”\\n\\nI say, “I would if I could, but\\n\\nI don’t do sketches from memory”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well,” she says, “I’m right here in front of you, or haven’t you looked?”\\n\\nI say, “All right, I know, but I don’t have my drawing book!”\\n\\nShe gives me a napkin, she says, “You can do it on that”\\n\\nI say, “Yes I could, but\\n\\nI don’t know where my pencil is at!”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe pulls one out from behind her ear\\n\\nShe says, “All right now, go ahead, draw me, I’m standing right here”\\n\\nI make a few lines and I show it for her to see\\n\\nWell she takes the napkin and throws it back\\n\\nAnd says, “That don’t look a thing like me!”\\n\\n\\n\\nI said, “Oh, kind Miss, it most certainly does”\\n\\nShe says, “You must be jokin’.” I say, “I wish I was!”\\n\\nThen she says, “You don’t read women authors, do you?”\\n\\nLeast that’s what I think I hear her say\\n\\n“Well,” I say, “how would you know and what would it matter anyway?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well,” she says, “you just don’t seem like you do!”\\n\\nI said, “You’re way wrong”\\n\\nShe says, “Which ones have you read then?” I say, “I read Erica Jong!”\\n\\nShe goes away for a minute\\n\\nAnd I slide up out of my chair\\n\\nI step outside back to the busy street but nobody’s going anywhere\\n\\n\\n\\nWell my heart’s in the Highlands with the horses and hounds\\n\\nWay up in the border country, far from the towns\\n\\nWith the twang of the arrow and a snap of the bow\\n\\nMy heart’s in the Highlands\\n\\nCan’t see any other way to go\\n\\n\\n\\nEvery day is the same thing out the door\\n\\nFeel further away then ever before\\n\\nSome things in life, it gets too late to learn\\n\\nWell, I’m lost somewhere\\n\\nI must have made a few bad turns\\n\\n\\n\\nI see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes\\n\\nThey’re drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes\\n\\nAll the young men with their young women looking so good\\n\\nWell, I’d trade places with any of them\\n\\nIn a minute, if I could\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog\\n\\nTalking to myself in a monologue\\n\\nI think what I need might be a full-length leather coat\\n\\nSomebody just asked me\\n\\nIf I registered to vote\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sun is beginning to shine on me\\n\\nBut it’s not like the sun that used to be\\n\\nThe party’s over and there’s less and less to say\\n\\nI got new eyes\\n\\nEverything looks far away\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, my heart’s in the Highlands at the break of day\\n\\nOver the hills and far away\\n\\nThere’s a way to get there and I’ll figure it out somehow\\n\\nBut I’m already there in my mind\\n\\nAnd that’s good enough for now\\n\\nI’m walking through streets that are dead\\n\\nWalking, walking with you in my head\\n\\nMy feet are so tired, my brain is so wired\\n\\nAnd the clouds are weeping\\n\\n\\n\\nDid I hear someone tell a lie?\\n\\nDid I hear someone’s distant cry?\\n\\nYou thrilled me to my heart, then you ripped it all apart\\n\\nYou went through my pockets when I was sleeping\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m sick of love…but I’m in the thick of it\\n\\nThis kind of love…I’m so sick of it\\n\\n\\n\\nI see lovers in the meadow\\n\\nI see silhouettes in the window\\n\\nI watch them ’til they’re gone and they leave me hanging on\\n\\nTo a shadow\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m sick of love…I hear the clock tick\\n\\nThis kind of love…I’m love sick\\n\\n\\n\\nSometimes the silence can be like the thunder\\n\\nSometimes I feel like I’m being plowed under\\n\\nCould you ever be true? I think of you\\n\\nAnd I wonder\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m sick of love…I wish I’d never met you\\n\\nI’m sick of love…I’m trying to forget you\\n\\n\\n\\nJust don’t know what to do\\n\\nI’d give anything to be with you\\n\\nGon’ walk down that dirt road, ’til someone lets me ride\\n\\nGon’ walk down that dirt road, ’til someone lets me ride\\n\\nIf I can’t find my baby, I’m gonna run away and hide\\n\\n\\n\\nI been pacing around the room hoping maybe she’d come back\\n\\nPacing ’round the room hoping maybe she’d come back\\n\\nWell, I been praying for salvation laying ’round in a one-room country shack\\n\\n\\n\\nGon’ walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed\\n\\nGon’ walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed\\n\\n’Til there’s nothing left to see, ’til the chains have been shattered and I’ve been freed\\n\\n\\n\\nI been lookin’ at my shadow, I been watching the colors up above\\n\\nLookin’ at my shadow, watching the colors up above\\n\\nRolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love\\n\\n\\n\\nGon’ walk on down that dirt road ’til I’m right beside the sun\\n\\nGon’ walk on down until I’m right beside the sun\\n\\nI’m gonna have to put up a barrier to keep myself away from everyone\\n\\nI’m beginning to hear voices and there’s no one around\\n\\nWell, I’m all used up and the fields have turned brown\\n\\nI went to church on Sunday and she passed by\\n\\nMy love for her is taking such a long time to die\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m waist deep, waist deep in the mist\\n\\nIt’s almost like, almost like I don’t exist\\n\\nI’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound\\n\\n\\n\\nThe walls of pride are high and wide\\n\\nCan’t see over to the other side\\n\\nIt’s such a sad thing to see beauty decay\\n\\nIt’s sadder still to feel your heart torn away\\n\\n\\n\\nOne look at you and I’m out of control\\n\\nLike the universe has swallowed me whole\\n\\nI’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s too many people, too many to recall\\n\\nI thought some of ’m were friends of mine, I was wrong about ’m all\\n\\nWell, the road is rocky and the hillside’s mud\\n\\nUp over my head nothing but clouds of blood\\n\\n\\n\\nI found my world, found my world in you\\n\\nBut your love just hasn’t proved true\\n\\nI’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound\\n\\nTwenty miles out of town in cold irons bound\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds\\n\\nReality has always had too many heads\\n\\nSome things last longer than you think they will\\n\\nThere are some kind of things you can never kill\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s you and you only I been thinking about\\n\\nBut you can’t see in and it’s hard lookin’ out\\n\\nI’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound\\n\\n\\n\\nWell the fat’s in the fire and the water’s in the tank\\n\\nThe whiskey’s in the jar and the money’s in the bank\\n\\nI tried to love and protect you because I cared\\n\\nI’m gonna remember forever the joy that we shared\\n\\n\\n\\nLooking at you and I’m on my bended knee\\n\\nYou have no idea what you do to me\\n\\nI’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound\\n\\nTwenty miles out of town in cold irons bound\\n\\n\\nThe seasons they are turnin’\\n\\nAnd my sad heart is yearnin’\\n\\nTo hear again the songbird’s sweet melodious tone\\n\\nMeet me in the moonlight alone\\n\\n\\n\\nThe dusky light, the day is losing\\n\\nOrchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan\\n\\nThe earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone\\n\\nMeet me in the moonlight alone\\n\\n\\n\\nThe air is thick and heavy\\n\\nAll along the levee\\n\\nWhere the geese into the countryside have flown\\n\\nMeet me in the moonlight alone\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I’m preachin’ peace and harmony\\n\\nThe blessings of tranquility\\n\\nFloating like a dream across the floor\\n\\nI’ll take you ’cross the river dear\\n\\nYou’ve no need to linger here\\n\\nDraw the blinds, step outside the door\\n\\n\\n\\nThe clouds are turnin’ crimson\\n\\nThe leaves fall from the limbs an’\\n\\nThe branches cast their shadows over stone\\n\\nMeet me in the moonlight alone\\n\\n\\n\\nThe boulevards of Cypress trees\\n\\nThe masquerades of birds and bees\\n\\nThe petals, pink and white, the wind has blown\\n\\nMeet me in the moonlight alone\\n\\n\\n\\nThe trailing moss and mystic glow\\n\\nPurple blossoms soft as snow\\n\\nStep up and drop the coin right into the slot\\n\\nThe fading light of sunset glowed\\n\\nIt’s crowded on the narrow road\\n\\nWho cares whether you forgive me or not\\n\\n\\n\\nMy pulse is runnin’ through my palm\\n\\nThe sharp hills are rising from\\n\\nThe yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan\\n\\nMeet me in the moonlight alone\\n\\n\\nBye and bye, I’m breathin’ a lover’s sigh\\n\\nI’m sittin’ on my watch so I can be on time\\n\\nI’m singin’ love’s praises with sugar-coated rhyme\\n\\nBye and bye, on you I’m casting my eye\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m paintin’ the town—swinging my partner around\\n\\nI know who I can depend on, I know who to trust\\n\\nI’m watchin’ the roads, I’m studying the dust\\n\\nI’m paintin’ the town making my last go-round\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I’m slippin’ and slidin’, walkin’ on briars\\n\\nTo get to the one that my heart desires\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m rollin’ slow—I’m doing all I know\\n\\nI’m tellin’ myself I found true happiness\\n\\nThat I’ve still got a dream that hasn’t been repossessed\\n\\nI’m rollin’ slow, goin’ where the wild red roses grow\\n\\n\\n\\nWell the future for me is already a thing of the past\\n\\nYou were my first love and you will be my last\\n\\n\\n\\nPapa gone mad, mama, she’s feeling sad\\n\\nI’ll establish my rule through civil war\\n\\nBring it on up from the ocean’s floor\\n\\nI’ll take you higher just so you can see the fire\\n\\n\\nTweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee\\n\\nThey’re throwing knives into the tree\\n\\nTwo big bags of dead man’s bones\\n\\nGot their noses to the grindstones\\n\\nLiving in the Land of

in the world\\'s ancient light\\n\\nWhere wisdom grows up in strife\\n\\nMy bewildering brain, toils in vain\\n\\nThrough the darkness on the pathways of life\\n\\nEach invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air\\n\\nTomorrow keeps turning around\\n\\nWe live and we die, we know not why\\n\\nBut I\\'ll be with you when the deal goes down\\n\\n\\n\\nWe eat and we drink, we feel and we think\\n\\nFar down the street we stray\\n\\nI laugh and I cry and I\\'m haunted by\\n\\nThings I never meant nor wished to say\\n\\nThe midnight rain follows the train\\n\\nWe all wear the same

live and then we forgive\\n\\nO\\'er the road we\\'re bound to go\\n\\nMore frailer than the flowers, these precious hours\\n\\nThat keep us so tightly bound\\n\\nYou come to my eyes like a vision from the skies\\n\\nAnd I\\'ll be with you when the deal goes down\\n\\n\\n\\nI picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes\\n\\nI followed the winding stream\\n\\nI heard a deafening noise, I

worry po’ me anymore\\n\\n\\nThere’s an evening’s haze settling over the town\\n\\nStarlight by the edge of the creek\\n\\nThe buying power of the proletariat’s gone down\\n\\nMoney’s getting shallow and weak\\n\\nThe place I love best is a sweet memory\\n\\nIt’s a new path that we trod\\n\\nThey say low wages are a reality\\n\\nIf we want to compete abroad\\n\\n\\n\\nMy cruel weapons been laid back on the shelf\\n\\nCome and sit down on my knee\\n\\nYou are dearer to me than myself\\n\\nAs you yourself can see\\n\\nI’m listening to the steel rails hum\\n\\nGot both eyes tight shut\\n\\nI’m just trying to keep the hunger from\\n\\nCreepin’ its way into my gut\\n\\n\\n\\nMeet me at the bottom, don’t lag behind\\n\\nBring me my boots and shoes\\n\\nYou can hang back or fight your best on the front line\\n\\nSing a little bit of these workingman’s blues\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m sailing on back getting ready for the long haul\\n\\nLeaving everything behind\\n\\nIf I stay here I’ll lose it all\\n\\nThe bandits will rob me blind\\n\\nI’m trying to feed my soul with thought\\n\\nGonna sleep off the rest of the day\\n\\nSometimes nobody wants what you got\\n\\nSometimes you can’t give it away\\n\\n\\n\\nI woke up this morning and sprang to my feet\\n\\nWent into town on a whim\\n\\nI saw my father there in the street\\n\\nAt least I think it was him\\n\\nIn the dark I hear the night birds call\\n\\nThe hills are rugged and steep\\n\\nI sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall\\n\\nIf I told you my whole story you’d weep\\n\\n\\n\\nMeet me at the bottom, don’t lag behind\\n\\nBring me my boots and shoes\\n\\nYou can hang back or fight your best on the front line\\n\\nSing a little bit of these workingman’s blues\\n\\n\\n\\nThey burned my barn and they stole my horse\\n\\nI can’t save a dime\\n\\nIt’s a long way down and I don’t want to be forced\\n\\nInto a life of continual crime\\n\\nI can see for myself that the sun is sinking\\n\\nO’er the banks of the deep blue sea\\n\\nTell me, am I wrong in thinking\\n\\nThat you have forgotten me\\n\\n\\n\\nNow they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret\\n\\nThey waste your nights and days\\n\\nThem, I will forget\\n\\nYou, I’ll remember always\\n\\nIt’s a cold black night and it’s midsummer’s eve\\n\\nAnd the stars are spinning around\\n\\nI still find it so hard to believe\\n\\nThat someone would kick me when I’m down\\n\\n\\n\\nMeet me at the bottom, don’t lag behind\\n\\nBring me my boots and shoes\\n\\nYou can hang back or fight your best on the front line\\n\\nSing a little bit of these workingman’s blues\\n\\n\\n\\nI’ll be back home in a month or two\\n\\nWhen the frost is on the vine\\n\\nI’ll punch my spear right straight through\\n\\nHalf-ways down your spine\\n\\nI’ll lift up my arms to the starry skies\\n\\nAnd pray the fugitive’s prayer\\n\\nI’m guessing tomorrow the sun will rise\\n\\nI hope the final judgment’s fair\\n\\n\\n\\nThe battle is over up in the hills\\n\\nAnd the mist is closing in\\n\\nLook at me, with all of my spoils\\n\\nWhat did I ever win?\\n\\nGotta brand new suit and a brand new wife\\n\\nI can live on rice and beans\\n\\nSome people never worked a day in their life\\n\\nThey don’t know what work even means\\n\\n\\n\\nMeet me at the bottom, don’t lag behind\\n\\nBring me my boots and shoes\\n\\nYou can hang back or fight your best on the front line Sing a little bit of these workingman’s blues\\n\\nBeyond the horizon, behind the sun\\n\\nAt the end of the rainbow life has only begun\\n\\nIn the long hours of twilight ’neath the stardust above\\n\\nBeyond the horizon it is easy to love\\n\\nI’m staring out the window\\n\\nOf an ancient town\\n\\nPetals from flowers\\n\\nFalling to the ground\\n\\nBeyond the horizon, in the springtime or fall\\n\\nLove waits forever, for one and for all\\n\\n\\n\\nBeyond the horizon, across the divide\\n\\n’Round about midnight, we’ll be on the same side\\n\\nDown in the valley the water runs cold\\n\\nBeyond the horizon someone’s prayin’ for your soul\\n\\nI lost my true lover\\n\\nIn the dusk, in the dawn\\n\\nI have to recover\\n\\nGet up and go on\\n\\nBeyond the horizon, beyond love’s burning game\\n\\nEvery step that you take, I’m walking the same\\n\\n\\n\\nBeyond the horizon, the night winds blow\\n\\nThe theme of a melody from many moons ago\\n\\nThe bells of St. Mary, how sweetly they chime\\n\\nBeyond the horizon I found you just in time\\n\\nSlipping and sliding\\n\\nToo late to stop\\n\\nRiding and gliding\\n\\nIt’s lonely at the top\\n\\nBeyond the horizon, the sky is so blue\\n\\nI’ve got more than a lifetime to live lovin’ you\\n\\n\\nLost John sittin\\' on a railroad track\\n\\nSomething\\'s out of wack\\n\\nBlues this morning falling down like hail\\n\\nGonna leave a greasy trail\\n\\n\\n\\nGonna travel the world is what I\\'m gonna do\\n\\nThen come back and see you\\n\\nAll I ever do is struggle and strive\\n\\nIf I don\\'t do anybody any harm, I might make it back home alive\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'m the oldest son of a crazy man\\n\\nI\\'m in a cowboy band\\n\\nGot a pile of sins to pay for and I ain\\'t got time to hide\\n\\nI\\'d walk

down to me someday\\n\\n\\nIt was late last night when the boss came home\\n\\nTo a deserted mansion and a desolate throne\\n\\nServant said, “Boss, the lady’s gone\\n\\nShe left this morning just ‘fore dawn.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You got something to tell me, tell it to me, man.\\n\\nCome to the point as straight as you can.”\\n\\n“Old Henry Lee, chief of the clan,\\n\\nCame riding through the woods and took her by the hand.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe boss he laid back flat on his bed\\n\\nHe cursed the heat and he clutched his head\\n\\nHe pondered the future of his fate\\n\\nTo wait another day would be far too late\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Go fetch me my coat and my tie\\n\\nAnd the cheapest labor that money can buy\\n\\nSaddle me up my buckskin mare\\n\\nIf you see me go by, put up a prayer.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, they rode all night and they rode all day\\n\\nEastward long on the broad highway\\n\\nHis spirit was tired and his vision was bent\\n\\nHis men deserted him and onward he went\\n\\n\\n\\nHe came to a place where the light was dull\\n\\nHis forehead pounding in his skull\\n\\nHeavy heart was wracked with pain\\n\\nInsomnia raging in his brain\\n\\n\\n\\nWell he threw down his helmet and his cross-handled sword\\n\\nHe renounced his faith, he denied his Lord\\n\\nCrawled on his belly, put his ear to the wall\\n\\nOne way or another he\\'d put an end to it all\\n\\n\\n\\nHe leaned down, cut the electric wire\\n\\nStared into the flames and he snorted the fire\\n\\nPeered through the darkness, caught a glimpse of the two\\n\\nIt was hard to tell for certain who was who\\n\\n\\n\\nHe lowered himself down on a golden chain\\n\\nHis nerves were quaking in every vein\\n\\nHis knuckles were bloody, he sucked in the air\\n\\nHe ran his fingers through his greasy hair\\n\\n\\n\\nThey looked at each other and their glasses clinked\\n\\nOne single unit inseparably linked\\n\\n“Got a strange premonition there’s a man close by.”\\n\\n“Don’t worry about him, he wouldn’t harm a fly.”\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom behind the curtain the boss crossed the floor\\n\\nHe moved his feet and he bolted the door\\n\\nShadows hiding the lines in his face\\n\\nWith all the nobility of an ancient race\\n\\n\\n\\nShe turned, she was startled with a look of surprise\\n\\nWith a hatred that could hit the skies\\n\\n“You’re a reckless fool, I can see it in your eyes.\\n\\nTo come this way was by no means wise.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Get up, stand up, you greedy lipped wench\\n\\nAnd cover your face or suffer the consequence.\\n\\nYou are making my heart full sick.\\n\\nPut your clothes back on double quick.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Silly boy, you think me a saint.\\n\\nI’ll listen no more to your words of complaint.\\n\\nYou’ve given me nothing but the sweetest lies.\\n\\nNow hold your tongue and feed your eyes.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’d have given you the stars and the planets too\\n\\nBut what good would these things do you?\\n\\nBow the heart, if not the knee\\n\\nOr never again this world you’ll see.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, please let not your heart be cold.\\n\\nThis man is dearer to me than gold.”\\n\\n“Oh my dear, you must be blind.\\n\\nHe’s a gutless ape with a worthless mind.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You had your way too long with me.\\n\\nNow it’s me who’ll determine how things shall be.\\n\\nTry to escape,” he cussed and cursed\\n\\n“You’ll have to try to get past me first.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I dare not let your passion rule.\\n\\nYou think my heart, the heart of a fool.\\n\\nAnd you sir, you cannot deny\\n\\nYou made a monkey of me, what and for why?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’ll have no more of this insulting chat.\\n\\nThe devil can have you, I’ll see to that.\\n\\nLook sharp or step aside,\\n\\nOr in the cradle you’ll wish you died.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe gun went boom and the shot rang clear\\n\\nFirst bullet grazed his ear\\n\\nSecond ball went right straight in\\n\\nAnd he bent in the middle like a twisted pin\\n\\n\\n\\nHe crawled to the corner and he lowered his head\\n\\nHe gripped the chair and he grabbed the bed\\n\\nIt would take more than needle and thread\\n\\nBleeding from the mouth, he’s as good as dead\\n\\n\\n\\n“You shot my husband down, you fiend.”\\n\\n“Husband, what husband, what the hell do you mean?\\n\\nHe was a man of strife, a man of sin.\\n\\nI cut him down and I’ll throw him to the wind.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Hear this,” she said, with angry breath\\n\\n“You too shall meet the lord of death.\\n\\nIt was I who brought your soul to life.”\\n\\nAnd she raised her robe and she drew out a knife\\n\\n\\n\\nHis face was hard and caked with sweat\\n\\nHis arms ached and his hands were wet\\n\\n“You’re a murderous queen and a bloody wife.\\n\\nIf you don’t mind, I’ll have the knife.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“We’re two of a kind and our blood runs hot.\\n\\nBut we’re no way similar in body and thought.\\n\\nAll husbands are good men, as all wives know.”\\n\\nThen she pierced him to the heart and his blood did flow\\n\\n\\n\\nHis knees went limp and he reached for the door\\n\\nHis doom was sealed, he slid to the floor\\n\\nHe whispered in her ear, “This is all your fault.\\n\\nMy fighting days have come to a halt.”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe touched his lip and kissed his cheek\\n\\nHe tried to speak, but his breath was weak\\n\\n“You died for me, now I\\'ll die for you.”\\n\\nShe put the blade to her heart and she ran it through\\n\\n\\n\\nAll three lovers together in a heap\\n\\nThrown into the grave forever to sleep\\n\\nFuneral torches blazed away\\n\\nThrough the towns and the villages all night and all day\\n\\nThe pale moon rose in its glory\\n\\nOut on the western town\\n\\nShe told a sad, sad story\\n\\nOf the great ship that went down\\n\\n\\n\\n‘Twas the fourteen day of April\\n\\nOver the waves she rode\\n\\nSailing into tomorrow\\n\\nTo a golden age foretold\\n\\n\\n\\nThe night was bright with starlight\\n\\nThe seas were sharp and clear\\n\\nMoving through the shadows\\n\\nThe promised hour was near\\n\\n\\n\\nLights were holding steady\\n\\nGliding over the foam\\n\\nAll the lords and ladies\\n\\nHeading for their eternal home\\n\\n\\n\\nThe chandeliers were swaying\\n\\nFrom the balustrades above\\n\\nThe orchestra was playing\\n\\nSongs of faded love\\n\\n\\n\\nThe watchman he lay dreaming\\n\\nAs the ballroom dancers twirled\\n\\nHe dreamed the Titanic was sinking\\n\\nInto the underworld\\n\\n\\n\\nLeo took his sketchbook\\n\\nHe was often so inclined\\n\\nHe closed his eyes and painted\\n\\nThe scenery in his mind\\n\\n\\n\\nCupid struck his bosom\\n\\nAnd broke it with a snap\\n\\nThe closest woman to him\\n\\nHe fell into her lap\\n\\n\\n\\nHe heard a loud commotion\\n\\nSomething sounded wrong\\n\\nHis inner spirit was saying\\n\\nThat he couldn’t stand here long\\n\\n\\n\\nHe staggered to the quarterdeck\\n\\nNo time now to sleep\\n\\nWater on the quarterdeck\\n\\nAlready three foot deep\\n\\n\\n\\nSmokestack leaning sideways\\n\\nHeavy feet began to pound\\n\\nHe walked into the whirlwind\\n\\nSky spinning all around\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ship was going under\\n\\nThe universe opened wide\\n\\nThe roll was called up yonder\\n\\nThe angels turned aside\\n\\n\\n\\nLights down in the hallway\\n\\nFlickering dim and dull\\n\\nDead bodies already floating\\n\\nIn the double bottomed hull\\n\\n\\n\\nThe engines then exploded\\n\\nPropellers they failed to start\\n\\nThe boilers overloaded\\n\\nThe ship\\'s bow split apart\\n\\n\\n\\nPassengers were flying\\n\\nBackward, forward, far and fast\\n\\nThey mumbled, fumbled, tumbled\\n\\nEach one more weary than the last\\n\\n\\n\\nThe veil was torn asunder\\n\\n‘Tween the hours of twelve and one\\n\\nNo change, no sudden wonder\\n\\nCould undo what had been done\\n\\n\\n\\nThe watchman lay there dreaming\\n\\nAt fourty-five degrees\\n\\nHe dreamed the Titanic was sinking\\n\\nDropping to her knees\\n\\n\\n\\nWellington, he was sleeping\\n\\nHis bed began to slide\\n\\nHis valiant heart was beating\\n\\nHe pushed the tables aside\\n\\n\\n\\nGlass of shattered crystal\\n\\nLay scattered ‘round about\\n\\nHe strapped on both his pistols\\n\\nHow long could he hold out?\\n\\n\\n\\nHis men and his companions\\n\\nWere nowhere to be seen\\n\\nIn silence there he waited for\\n\\nTime and space to intervene\\n\\n\\n\\nThe passageway was narrow\\n\\nThere was blackness in the air\\n\\nHe saw every kind of sorrow\\n\\nHeard voices everywhere\\n\\n\\n\\nAlarm bells were ringing\\n\\nTo hold back the swelling tide\\n\\nFriends and lovers clinging\\n\\nTo each other side by side\\n\\n\\n\\nMothers

that you all know well\\n\\nIt’s hard times in the city\\n\\nLivin’ down in New York town\\n\\n\\n\\nOld New York City is a friendly old town\\n\\nFrom Washington Heights to Harlem on down\\n\\nThere’s a-mighty many people all millin’ all around\\n\\nThey’ll kick you when you’re up and knock you when you’re down\\n\\nIt’s hard times in the city\\n\\nLivin’ down in New York town\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate\\n\\nTo Rockefeller Plaza ’n’ the Empire State.\\n\\nMister Rockefeller sets up as high as a bird\\n\\nOld Mister Empire never says a word\\n\\nIt’s hard times from the country\\n\\nLivin’ down in New York town\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, it’s up in the mornin’ tryin’ to find a job of work\\n\\nStand in one place till your feet begin to hurt\\n\\nIf you got a lot o’ money you can make yourself merry\\n\\nIf you only got a nickel, it’s the Staten Island Ferry\\n\\nAnd it’s hard times in the city\\n\\nLivin’ down in New York town\\n\\n\\n\\nMister Hudson come a-sailin’ down the stream\\n\\nAnd old Mister Minuet paid for his dream\\n\\nBought your city on a one-way track\\n\\n’F I had my way I’d sell it right back\\n\\nAnd it’s hard times in the city\\n\\nLivin’ down in New York town\\n\\n\\n\\nI’ll take all the smog in Cal-i-for-ne-ay\\n\\n’N’ every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains\\n\\n’N’ the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines\\n\\nIt’s all much cleaner than the New York kind\\n\\nAnd it’s hard times in the city\\n\\nLivin’ down in New York town\\n\\n\\n\\nSo all you newsy people, spread the news around\\n\\nYou c’n listen to m’ story, listen to m’ song\\n\\nYou c’n step on my name, you c’n try ’n’ get me beat\\n\\nWhen I leave New York, I’ll be standin’ on my feet\\n\\nAnd it’s hard times in the city\\n\\nLivin’ down in New York town\\n\\n’ll sing you a song, ain’t very long\\n\\n’Bout an old man who never done wrong\\n\\nHow he died nobody can say\\n\\nThey found him dead in the street one day\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, the crowd, they gathered one fine morn\\n\\nAt the man whose clothes ’n’ shoes were torn\\n\\nThere on the sidewalk he did lay\\n\\nThey stopped ’n’ stared ’n’ walked their way\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, the p’liceman come and he looked around\\n\\n“Get up, old man, or I’m a-takin’ you down”\\n\\nHe jabbed him once with his billy club\\n\\nAnd the old man then rolled off the curb\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, he jabbed him again and loudly said\\n\\n“Call the wagon; this man is dead”\\n\\nThe wagon come, they loaded him in\\n\\nI never saw the man again\\n\\n\\n\\nI’ve sung you my song, it ain’t very long\\n\\n’Bout an old man who never done wrong\\n\\nHow he died no one can say\\n\\nThey found him dead in the street one day\\n\\nI saw it advertised one day\\n\\nBear Mountain picnic was comin’ my way\\n\\n“Come along ’n’ take a trip\\n\\nWe’ll bring you up there on a ship\\n\\nBring the wife and kids\\n\\nBring the whole family”\\n\\nYippee!\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I run right down ’n’ bought a ticket\\n\\nTo this Bear Mountain Picnic\\n\\nBut little did I realize\\n\\nI was in for a picnic surprise\\n\\nHad nothin’ to do with mountains\\n\\nI didn’t even come close to a bear\\n\\n\\n\\nTook the wife ’n’ kids down to the pier\\n\\nSix thousand people there\\n\\nEverybody had a ticket for the trip\\n\\n“Oh well,” I said, “it’s a pretty big ship\\n\\nBesides, anyway, the more the merrier”\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, we all got on ’n’ what d’ya think\\n\\nThat big old boat started t’ sink\\n\\nMore people kept a-pilin’ on\\n\\nThat old ship was a-slowly goin’ down\\n\\nFunny way t’ start a picnic\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I soon lost track of m’ kids ’n’ wife\\n\\nSo many people there I never saw in m’ life\\n\\nThat old ship sinkin’ down in the water\\n\\nSix thousand people tryin’ t’ kill each other\\n\\nDogs a-barkin’, cats a-meowin’\\n\\nWomen screamin’, fists a-flyin’, babies cryin’\\n\\nCops a-comin’, me a-runnin’\\n\\nMaybe we just better call off the picnic\\n\\n\\n\\nI got shoved down ’n’ pushed around\\n\\nAll I could hear there was a screamin’ sound\\n\\nDon’t remember one thing more\\n\\nJust remember wakin’ up on a little shore\\n\\nHead busted, stomach cracked\\n\\nFeet splintered, I was bald, naked . . .\\n\\nQuite lucky to be alive though\\n\\n\\n\\nFeelin’ like I climbed outa m’ casket\\n\\nI grabbed back hold of m’ picnic basket\\n\\nTook the wife ’n’ kids ’n’ started home\\n\\nWishin’ I’d never got up that morn\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, I don’t care just what you do\\n\\nIf you wanta have a picnic, that’s up t’ you\\n\\nBut don’t tell me about it, I don’t wanta hear it\\n\\n’Cause, see, I just lost all m’ picnic spirit\\n\\nStay in m’ kitchen, have m’ own picnic . . .\\n\\nIn the bathroom\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, it don’t seem to me quite so funny\\n\\nWhat some people are gonna do f’r money\\n\\nThere’s a bran’ new gimmick every day\\n\\nJust t’ take somebody’s money away\\n\\nI think we oughta take some o’ these people\\n\\nAnd put ’em on a boat, send ’em up to Bear Mountain . . .\\n\\nFor a picnic\\n\\n\\nI will not go down under the ground\\n\\n’Cause somebody tells me that death’s comin’ ’round\\n\\nAn’ I will not carry myself down to die\\n\\nWhen I go to my grave my head will be high\\n\\nLet me die in my footsteps\\n\\nBefore I go down under the ground\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s been rumors of war and wars that have been\\n\\nThe meaning of life has been lost in the wind\\n\\nAnd some people thinkin’ that the end is close by\\n\\n’Stead of learnin’ to live they are learnin’ to die\\n\\nLet me die in my footsteps\\n\\nBefore I go down under the ground\\n\\n\\n\\nI don’t know if I’m smart but I think I can see\\n\\nWhen someone is pullin’ the wool over me\\n\\nAnd if this war comes and death’s all around\\n\\nLet me die on this land ’fore I die underground\\n\\nLet me die in my footsteps\\n\\nBefore I go down under the ground\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s always been people that have to cause fear\\n\\nThey’ve been talking of the war now for many long years\\n\\nI have read all their statements and I’ve not said a word\\n\\nBut now Lawd God, let my poor voice be heard\\n\\nLet me die in my footsteps\\n\\nBefore I go down under the ground\\n\\n\\n\\nIf I had rubies and riches and crowns\\n\\nI’d buy the whole world and change things around\\n\\nI’d throw all the guns and the tanks in the sea\\n\\nFor they are mistakes of a past history\\n\\nLet me die in my footsteps\\n\\nBefore I go down under the ground\\n\\n\\n\\nLet me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood\\n\\nLet the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood\\n\\nLet me sleep in your meadows with the green grassy leaves\\n\\nLet me walk down the highway with my brother in peace\\n\\nLet me die in my footsteps\\n\\nBefore I go down under the ground\\n\\n\\n\\nGo out in your country where the land meets the sun\\n\\nSee the craters and the canyons where the waterfalls run\\n\\nNevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho\\n\\nLet every state in this union seep down deep in your souls\\n\\nAnd you’ll die in your footsteps\\n\\nBefore you go down under the ground\\n\\nCome around you rovin’ gamblers and a story I will tell\\n\\nAbout the greatest gambler, you all should know him well\\n\\nHis name was Will O’Conley and he gambled all his life\\n\\nHe had twenty-seven children, yet he never had a wife\\n\\nAnd it’s ride, Willie, ride\\n\\nRoll, Willie, roll\\n\\nWherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows\\n\\n\\n\\nHe gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards\\n\\nWherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards\\n\\nHe had the reputation as the gamblin’est man around\\n\\nWives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town\\n\\nAnd it’s ride, Willie, ride\\n\\nRoll, Willie, roll\\n\\nWherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows\\n\\n\\n\\nSailin’ down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans\\n\\nThey’re still talkin’ about their card game on that Jackson River Queen\\n\\n“I’ve come to win some money,” Gamblin’ Willie says\\n\\nWhen the game finally ended up, the whole damn boat was his\\n\\nAnd it’s ride, Willie, ride\\n\\nRoll, Willie, roll\\n\\nWherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows\\n\\n\\n\\nUp in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek\\n\\nThere was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week\\n\\nNine hundred miners had laid their money down\\n\\nWhen Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole damn town\\n\\nAnd it’s ride, Willie, ride\\n\\nRoll, Willie, roll\\n\\nWherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true\\n\\nHe supported all his children and all their mothers too\\n\\nHe wore no rings or fancy things, like other gamblers wore\\n\\nHe spread his money far and wide, to help the sick and the poor\\n\\nAnd it’s ride, Willie, ride\\n\\nRoll, Willie, roll\\n\\nWherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew\\n\\nWhether he was bluffin’ or whether he was true\\n\\nHe won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair\\n\\nThe man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn’t even have a pair\\n\\nAnd it’s ride, Willie, ride\\n\\nRoll, Willie, roll\\n\\nWherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was late one evenin’ during a poker game\\n\\nA man lost all his money, he said Willie was to blame\\n\\nHe shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate\\n\\nWhen Willie’s cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights\\n\\nAnd it’s ride, Willie, ride\\n\\nRoll, Willie, roll\\n\\nWherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows\\n\\n\\n\\nSo all you rovin’ gamblers, wherever you might be\\n\\nThe moral of the story is very plain to see\\n\\nMake your money while you can, before you have to stop\\n\\nFor when you pull that dead man’s hand, your gamblin’ days are up\\n\\nAnd it’s ride, Willie, ride\\n\\nRoll, Willie, roll\\n\\nWherever you are a-gamblin’ now, nobody really knows\\n\\nHere\\'s a foreign song I learned in Utah\\n\\nHa-va-ne-gei-lah\\n\\nO-de-ley-e-e-oo-\\n\\nOh, you can read out your Bible\\n\\nYou can fall down on your knees, pretty mama\\n\\nAnd pray to

bone\\n \\n New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years\\n \\n I didn’t feel so cold then\\n \\n \\n \\n I swung onto my old guitar\\n \\n Grabbed hold of a subway car\\n \\n And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride\\n \\n I landed up on the downtown side\\n \\n Greenwich Village\\n \\n \\n \\n I walked down there and ended up\\n \\n In one of them coffee-houses on the block\\n \\n Got on the stage to sing and play\\n \\n Man there said, “Come back some other day\\n \\n You sound like a hillbilly\\n \\n We want folk singers here”\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play\\n \\n Blowin’ my lungs out for a dollar a day\\n \\n I blowed inside out and upside down\\n \\n The man there said he loved m’ sound\\n \\n He was ravin’ about how he loved m’ sound\\n \\n Dollar a day’s worth\\n \\n \\n \\n And after weeks and weeks of hangin’ around\\n \\n I finally got a job in New York town\\n \\n In a bigger place, bigger money too\\n \\n Even joined the union and paid m’ dues\\n \\n \\n \\n Now, a very great man once said\\n \\n That some people rob you with a fountain pen\\n \\n It didn’t take too long to find out\\n \\n Just what he was talkin’ about\\n \\n A lot of people don’t have much food on their table\\n \\n But they got a lot of forks ’n’ knives\\n \\n And they gotta cut somethin’\\n \\n \\n \\n So one mornin’ when the sun was warm\\n \\n I rambled out of New York town\\n \\n Pulled my cap down over my eyes\\n \\n And headed out for the western skies\\n \\n So long, New York\\n \\n Howdy, East Orange\\n\\nI’m out here a thousand miles from my home\\n \\n Walkin’ a road other men have gone down\\n \\n I’m seein’ your world of people and things\\n \\n Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings\\n \\n \\n \\n Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song\\n \\n ’Bout a funny ol’ world that’s a-comin’ along\\n \\n Seems sick an’ it’s hungry, it’s tired an’ it’s torn\\n \\n It looks like it’s a-dyin’ an’ it’s hardly been born\\n \\n \\n \\n Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know\\n \\n All the things that I’m a-sayin’ an’ a-many times more\\n \\n I’m a-singin’ you the song, but I can’t sing enough\\n \\n ’Cause there’s not many men that done the things that you’ve done\\n \\n \\n \\n Here’s to Cisco an’ Sonny an’ Leadbelly too\\n \\n An’ to all the good people that traveled with you\\n \\n Here’s to the hearts and the hands of the men\\n \\n That come with the dust and are gone with the wind\\n \\n \\n \\n I’m a-leavin’ tomorrow, but I could leave today\\n \\n Somewhere down the road someday\\n \\n The very last thing that I’d want to do\\n \\n Is to say I’ve been hittin’ some hard travelin’ too\\n\\nWho killed Davey Moore\\n\\nWhy an’ what’s the reason for?\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not I,” says the referee\\n\\n“Don’t point your finger at me\\n\\nI could’ve stopped it in the eighth\\n\\nAn’ maybe kept him from his fate\\n\\nBut the crowd would’ve booed, I’m sure\\n\\nAt not gettin’ their money’s worth\\n\\nIt’s too bad he had to go\\n\\nBut there was a pressure on me too, you know\\n\\nIt wasn’t me that made him fall\\n\\nNo, you can’t blame me at all”\\n\\n\\n\\nWho killed Davey Moore\\n\\nWhy an’ what’s the reason for?\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not us,” says the angry crowd\\n\\nWhose screams filled the arena loud\\n\\n“It’s too bad he died that night\\n\\nBut we just like to see a fight\\n\\nWe didn’t mean for him t’ meet his death\\n\\nWe just meant to see some sweat\\n\\nThere ain’t nothing wrong in that\\n\\nIt wasn’t us that made him fall\\n\\nNo, you can’t blame us at all”\\n\\n\\n\\nWho killed Davey Moore\\n\\nWhy an’ what’s the reason for?\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not me,” says his manager\\n\\nPuffing on a big cigar\\n\\n“It’s hard to say, it’s hard to tell\\n\\nI always thought that he was well\\n\\nIt’s too bad for his wife an’ kids he’s dead\\n\\nBut if he was sick, he should’ve said\\n\\nIt wasn’t me that made him fall\\n\\nNo, you can’t blame me at all”\\n\\n\\n\\nWho killed Davey Moore\\n\\nWhy an’ what’s the reason for?\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not me,” says the gambling man\\n\\nWith his ticket stub still in his hand\\n\\n“It wasn’t me that knocked him down\\n\\nMy hands never touched him none\\n\\nI didn’t commit no ugly sin\\n\\nAnyway, I put money on him to win\\n\\nIt wasn’t me that made him fall\\n\\nNo, you can’t blame me at all”\\n\\n\\n\\nWho killed Davey Moore\\n\\nWhy an’ what’s the reason for?\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not me,” says the boxing writer\\n\\nPounding print on his old typewriter\\n\\nSayin’, “Boxing ain’t to blame\\n\\nThere’s just as much danger in a football game”\\n\\nSayin’, “Fistfighting is here to stay\\n\\nIt’s just the old American way\\n\\nIt wasn’t me that made him fall\\n\\nNo, you can’t blame me at all”\\n\\n\\n\\nWho killed Davey Moore\\n\\nWhy an’ what’s the reason for?\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not me,” says the man whose fists\\n\\nLaid him low in a cloud of mist\\n\\nWho came here from Cuba’s door\\n\\nWhere boxing ain’t allowed no more\\n\\n“I hit him, yes, it’s true\\n\\nBut that’s what I am paid to do\\n\\nDon’t say ‘murder,’ don’t say ‘kill’\\n\\nIt was destiny, it was God’s will”\\n\\n\\n\\nWho killed Davey Moore\\n\\nWhy an’ what’s the reason for?\\n\\nWell, I was feelin’ sad and feelin’ blue\\n\\nI didn’t know what in the world I wus gonna do\\n\\nThem Communists they wus comin’ around\\n\\nThey wus in the air\\n\\nThey wus on the ground\\n\\nThey wouldn’t gimme no peace . . .\\n\\n\\n\\nSo I run down most hurriedly\\n\\nAnd joined up with the John Birch Society\\n\\nI got me a secret membership card\\n\\nAnd started off a-walkin’ down the road\\n\\nYee-hoo, I’m a real John Bircher now!\\n\\nLook out you Commies!\\n\\n\\n\\nNow we all agree with Hitler’s views\\n\\nAlthough he killed six million Jews\\n\\nIt don’t matter too much that he was a Fascist\\n\\nAt least you can’t say he was a Communist!\\n\\nThat’s to say like if you got a cold you take a shot of malaria\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I wus lookin’ everywhere for them gol-darned Reds\\n\\nI got up in the mornin’ ’n’ looked under my bed\\n\\nLooked in the sink, behind the door\\n\\nLooked in the glove compartment of my car\\n\\nCouldn’t find ’em . . .\\n\\n\\n\\nI wus lookin’ high an’ low for them Reds everywhere\\n\\nI wus lookin’ in the sink an’ underneath the chair\\n\\nI looked way up my chimney hole\\n\\nI even looked deep down inside my toilet bowl\\n\\nThey got away . . .\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I wus sittin’ home alone an’ started to sweat\\n\\nFigured they wus in my T.V. set\\n\\nPeeked behind the picture frame\\n\\nGot a shock from my feet, hittin’ right up in the brain\\n\\nThem Reds caused it!\\n\\nI know they did . . . them hard-core ones\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I quit my job so I could work all alone\\n\\nThen I changed my name to Sherlock Holmes\\n\\nFollowed some clues from my detective bag\\n\\nAnd discovered they wus red stripes on the American flag!\\n\\nThat ol’ Betsy Ross . . .\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I investigated all the books in the library\\n\\nNinety percent of ’em gotta be burned away\\n\\nI investigated all the people that I knowed\\n\\nNinety-eight percent of them gotta go\\n\\nThe other two percent are fellow Birchers . . . just like me\\n\\n\\n\\nNow Eisenhower, he’s a Russian spy\\n\\nLincoln, Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy\\n\\nTo my knowledge there’s just one man\\n\\nThat’s really a true American: George Lincoln Rockwell\\n\\nI know for a fact he hates Commies cus he picketed the movie Exodus\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I fin’ly started thinkin’ straight\\n\\nWhen I run outa things to investigate\\n\\nCouldn’t imagine doin’ anything else\\n\\nSo now I’m sittin’ home investigatin’ myself!\\n\\nHope I don’t find out anything . . . hmm, great God!\\n\\n\\nTrails of troubles\\n\\nRoads of battles\\n\\nPaths of victory\\n\\nI shall walk\\n\\n\\n\\nThe trail is dusty\\n\\nAnd my road it might be rough\\n\\nBut the better roads are waiting\\n\\nAnd boys it ain’t far off\\n\\n\\n\\nTrails of troubles\\n\\nRoads of battles\\n\\nPaths of victory\\n\\nWe shall walk\\n\\n\\n\\nI walked down by the river\\n\\nI turned my head up

rollin’\\n\\nI was walking down the track\\n\\nThere was a one-way wind a-blowin’\\n\\nAnd it was blowin’ at my back\\n\\n\\n\\nTrails of troubles\\n\\nRoads of battles\\n\\nPaths of victory\\n\\nWe shall walk\\n\\n\\n\\nThe gravel road is bumpy\\n\\nIt’s a hard road to ride\\n\\nBut there’s a clearer road a-waitin’\\n\\nWith the cinders on the side\\n\\n\\n\\nTrails of troubles\\n\\nRoads of battles\\n\\nPaths of victory\\n\\nWe shall walk\\n\\n\\n\\nThat evening train was rollin’\\n\\nThe hummin’ of its wheels\\n\\nMy eyes they saw a better day\\n\\nAs I looked across the fields\\n\\n\\n\\nTrails of troubles\\n\\nRoads of battles\\n\\nPaths of victory\\n\\nWe shall walk\\n\\n\\n\\nThe trail is dusty\\n\\nThe road it might be rough\\n\\nBut the good road is

freely:\\n\\nNo younger than twelve\\n\\nNo older ’n seventeen\\n\\nThrown in like bandits\\n\\nAnd cast off like criminals\\n\\nInside the walls\\n\\nThe walls of Red Wing\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom the dirty old mess hall\\n\\nYou march to the brick wall\\n\\nToo weary to talk\\n\\nAnd too tired to sing\\n\\nOh, it’s all afternoon\\n\\nYou remember your hometown\\n\\nInside the walls\\n\\nThe walls of Red Wing\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, the gates are cast iron\\n\\nAnd the walls are barbed wire\\n\\nStay far from the fence\\n\\nWith the ’lectricity sting\\n\\nAnd it’s keep down your head\\n\\nAnd stay in your number\\n\\nInside the walls\\n\\nThe walls of Red Wing\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, it’s fare thee well\\n\\nTo the deep hollow dungeon\\n\\nFarewell to the boardwalk\\n\\nThat takes you to the screen\\n\\nAnd farewell to the minutes\\n\\nThey threaten you with it\\n\\nInside the walls\\n\\nThe walls of Red Wing\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s many a guard\\n\\nThat stands around smilin’\\n\\nHoldin’ his club\\n\\nLike he was a king\\n\\nHopin’ to get you\\n\\nBehind a wood pilin’\\n\\nInside the walls\\n\\nThe walls of Red Wing\\n\\n\\n\\nThe night aimed shadows\\n\\nThrough the crossbar windows\\n\\nAnd the wind punched hard\\n\\nTo make the wall-siding sing\\n\\nIt’s many a night\\n\\nI pretended to be a-sleepin’\\n\\nInside the walls\\n\\nThe walls of Red Wing\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the rain rattled heavy\\n\\nOn the bunkhouse shingles\\n\\nAnd the sounds in the night\\n\\nThey made my ears ring\\n\\n’Til the keys of the guards\\n\\nClicked the tune of the morning\\n\\nInside the walls\\n\\nThe walls of Red Wing\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, some of us’ll end up\\n\\nIn St. Cloud Prison\\n\\nAnd some of us’ll wind up\\n\\nTo be lawyers and things\\n\\nAnd some of us’ll stand up\\n\\nTo meet you on your crossroads\\n\\nFrom inside the walls\\n\\nThe walls of Red Wing\\n\\nWhen yer head gets twisted and yer mind grows numb\\n\\nWhen you think you\\'re too old, too young, too smart or too dumb\\n\\nWhen yer laggin\\' behind an\\' losin\\' yer pace\\n\\nIn a slow-motion crawl of life\\'s busy race\\n\\nNo matter what yer doing if you start givin\\' up\\n\\nIf the wine don\\'t come to the top of yer cup\\n\\nIf the wind\\'s got you sideways with with one hand holdin\\' on\\n\\nAnd the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone\\n\\nAnd yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it\\n\\nAnd the wood\\'s easy findin\\' but yer lazy to fetch it\\n\\nAnd yer sidewalk starts curlin\\' and the street gets too long\\n\\nAnd you start walkin\\' backwards though you know its wrong\\n\\nAnd lonesome comes up as down goes the day\\n\\nAnd tomorrow\\'s mornin\\' seems so far away\\n\\nAnd you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin\\'\\n\\nAnd yer rope is a-slidin\\' \\'cause yer hands are a-drippin\\'\\n\\nAnd yer sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys\\n\\nTurn to broken down slums and trash-can alleys\\n\\nAnd yer sky cries water and yer drain pipe\\'s a-pourin\\'\\n\\nAnd the lightnin\\'s a-flashing and the thunder\\'s a-crashin\\'\\n\\nAnd the windows are rattlin\\' and breakin\\' and the roof tops a-shakin\\'\\n\\nAnd yer whole world\\'s a-slammin\\' and bangin\\'\\n\\nAnd yer minutes of sun turn to hours of storm\\n\\nAnd to yourself you sometimes say\\n\\n\"I never knew it was gonna be this way\\n\\nWhy didn\\'t they tell me the day I was born\"\\n\\nAnd you start gettin\\' chills and yer jumping from sweat\\n\\nAnd you\\'re lookin\\' for somethin\\' you ain\\'t quite found yet\\n\\nAnd yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the air\\n\\nAnd the whole world\\'s a-watchin\\' with a window peek stare\\n\\nAnd yer good gal leaves and she\\'s long gone a-flying\\n\\nAnd yer heart feels sick like fish when they\\'re fryin\\'\\n\\nAnd yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feet\\n\\nAnd you need it badly but it lays on the street\\n\\nAnd yer bell\\'s bangin\\' loudly but you can\\'t hear its beat\\n\\nAnd you think yer ears might a been hurt\\n\\nOr yer eyes\\'ve turned filthy from the sight-blindin\\' dirt\\n\\nAnd you figured you failed in yesterdays rush\\n\\nWhen you were faked out an\\' fooled white facing a four flush\\n\\nAnd all the time you were holdin\\' three queens\\n\\nAnd it\\'s makin you mad, it\\'s makin\\' you mean\\n\\nLike in the middle of Life magazine\\n\\nBouncin\\' around a pinball machine\\n\\nAnd there\\'s something on yer mind you wanna be saying\\n\\nThat somebody someplace oughta be hearin\\'\\n\\nBut it\\'s trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer head\\n\\nAnd it bothers you badly when your layin\\' in bed\\n\\nAnd no matter how you try you just can\\'t say it\\n\\nAnd yer scared to yer soul you just might forget it\\n\\nAnd yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer head\\n\\nAnd yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead\\n\\nAnd the lion\\'s mouth opens and yer staring at his teeth\\n\\nAnd his jaws start closin with you underneath\\n\\nAnd yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behind\\n\\nAnd you wish you\\'d never taken that last detour sign\\n\\nAnd you say to yourself just what am I doin\\'\\n\\nOn this road I\\'m walkin\\', on this trail I\\'m turnin\\'\\n\\nOn this curve I\\'m hanging\\n\\nOn this pathway I\\'m strolling, in the space I\\'m taking\\n\\nIn this air I\\'m inhaling\\n\\nAm I mixed up too much, am I mixed up too hard\\n\\nWhy am I walking, where am I running\\n\\nWhat am I saying, what am I knowing\\n\\nOn this guitar I\\'m playing, on this banjo I\\'m frailin\\'\\n\\nOn this mandolin I\\'m strummin\\', in the song I\\'m singin\\'\\n\\nIn the tune I\\'m hummin\\', in the words I\\'m writin\\'\\n\\nIn the words that I\\'m thinkin\\'\\n\\nIn this ocean of hours I\\'m all the time drinkin\\'\\n\\nWho am I helping, what am I breaking\\n\\nWhat am I giving, what am I taking\\n\\nBut you try with your whole soul best\\n\\nNever to think these thoughts and never to let\\n\\nThem kind of thoughts gain ground\\n\\nOr make yer heart pound\\n\\nBut then again you know why they\\'re around\\n\\nJust waiting for a chance to slip and drop down\\n\\n\"Cause sometimes you hear\\'em when the night times comes creeping\\n\\nAnd you fear that they might catch you a-sleeping\\n\\nAnd you jump from yer bed, from yer last chapter of dreamin\\'\\n\\nAnd you can\\'t remember for the best of yer thinking\\n\\nIf that was you in the dream that was screaming\\n\\nAnd you know that it\\'s something special you\\'re needin\\'\\n\\nAnd you know that there\\'s no drug that\\'ll do for the healin\\'\\n\\nAnd no liquor in the land to stop yer brain from bleeding\\n\\nAnd you need something special\\n\\nYeah, you need something special all right\\n\\nYou need a fast flyin\\' train on a tornado track\\n\\nTo shoot you someplace and shoot you back\\n\\nYou need a cyclone wind on a stream engine howler\\n\\nThat\\'s been banging and booming and blowing forever\\n\\nThat knows yer troubles a hundred times over\\n\\nYou need a Greyhound bus that don\\'t bar no race\\n\\nThat won\\'t laugh at yer looks\\n\\nYour voice or your face\\n\\nAnd by any number of bets in the book\\n\\nWill be rollin\\' long after the bubblegum craze\\n\\nYou need something to open up a new door\\n\\nTo show you something you seen before\\n\\nBut overlooked a hundred times or more\\n\\nYou need something to open your eyes\\n\\nYou need something to make it known\\n\\nThat it\\'s you and no one else that owns\\n\\nThat spot that yer standing, that space that you\\'re sitting\\n\\nThat the world ain\\'t got you beat\\n\\nThat it ain\\'t got you licked\\n\\nIt can\\'t get you crazy no matter how many\\n\\nTimes you might get kicked\\n\\nYou need something special all right\\n\\nYou need something special to give you hope\\n\\nBut hope\\'s just a word\\n\\nThat maybe you said or maybe you heard\\n\\nOn some windy corner \\'round a wide-angled curve\\n\\n\\n\\nBut that\\'s what you need man, and you need it bad\\n\\nAnd yer trouble is you know it too good\\n\\n\"Cause you look an\\' you start getting the chills\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Cause you can\\'t find it on a dollar bill\\n\\nAnd

around it\\n \\n I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it\\n \\n I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin’\\n \\n I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin’\\n \\n I saw a white ladder all covered with water\\n \\n I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken\\n \\n I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children\\n \\n And it’s a hard, and it’s a

\\n \\n Oxford Town, Oxford Town\\n \\n Ev’rybody’s got their heads bowed down\\n \\n The sun don’t shine above the ground\\n \\n Ain’t a-goin’ down to Oxford Town\\n\\nI sang the song slowly\\n\\nAs she stood in the shadows\\n\\nShe stepped to the light\\n\\nAs my silver strings spun\\n\\nShe called with her eyes\\n\\nTo the tune I’s a-playin’\\n\\nBut the song it was long\\n\\nAnd I’d only begun\\n\\n\\n\\nThrough a bullet of light\\n\\nHer face was reflectin’\\n\\nThe fast fading words\\n\\nThat rolled from my tongue\\n\\nWith a long-distance look\\n\\nHer eyes was on fire\\n\\nBut the song it was long\\n\\nAnd there was more to be sung\\n\\n\\n\\nMy eyes danced a circle\\n\\nAcross her clear outline\\n\\nWith her head tilted sideways\\n\\nShe called me again\\n\\nAs the tune drifted out\\n\\nShe breathed hard through the echo\\n\\nBut the song it was long\\n\\nAnd it was far to the end\\n\\n\\n\\nI glanced at my guitar\\n\\nAnd played it pretendin’\\n\\nThat of all the eyes out there\\n\\nI could see none\\n\\nAs her thoughts pounded hard\\n\\nLike the pierce of an arrow\\n\\nBut the song it was long\\n\\nAnd it had to get done\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the tune finally folded\\n\\nI laid down the guitar\\n\\nThen looked for the girl\\n\\nWho’d stayed for so long\\n\\nBut her shadow was missin’\\n\\nFor all of my searchin’\\n\\nSo I picked up my guitar\\n\\nAnd began the next song\\n\\nCorrina, Corrina\\n \\n Gal, where you been so long?\\n \\n Corrina, Corrina\\n \\n Gal, where you been so long?\\n \\n I been worr’in’ ’bout you, baby\\n \\n Baby, please come

crying.\\n\\nSome time ago a crazy dream came to me\\n \\n I dreamt I was walkin’ into World War Three\\n \\n I went to the doctor the very next day\\n \\n To see what kinda words he could say\\n \\n He said it was a bad dream\\n \\n I wouldn’t worry ’bout it none, though\\n \\n They were my own dreams and they’re only in my head\\n \\n \\n \\n I said, “Hold it, Doc, a World War passed through my brain”\\n \\n He said, “Nurse, get your pad, this boy’s insane”\\n \\n He grabbed my arm, I said, “Ouch!”\\n \\n As I landed on the psychiatric couch\\n \\n He said, “Tell me about it”\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, the whole thing started at 3 o’clock fast\\n \\n It was all over by quarter past\\n \\n I was down in the sewer with some little lover\\n \\n When I peeked out from a manhole cover\\n \\n Wondering who turned the lights on\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I got up and walked around\\n \\n And up and down the lonesome town\\n \\n I stood a-wondering which way to go\\n \\n I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road\\n \\n It was a normal day\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell\\n \\n And I leaned my head and I gave a yell\\n \\n “Give me a string bean, I’m a hungry man”\\n \\n A shotgun fired and away I ran\\n \\n I don’t blame them too much though, I know I look funny\\n \\n \\n \\n Down at the corner by a hot-dog stand\\n \\n I seen a man\\n \\n I said, “Howdy friend, I guess there’s just us two”\\n \\n He screamed a bit and away he flew\\n \\n Thought I was a Communist\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I spied a girl and before she could leave\\n \\n “Let’s go and play Adam and Eve”\\n \\n I took her by the hand and my heart it was thumpin’\\n \\n When she said, “Hey man, you crazy or sumpin’\\n \\n You see what happened last time they started”\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I seen a Cadillac window uptown\\n \\n And there was nobody aroun’\\n \\n I got into the driver’s seat\\n \\n And I drove down 42nd Street\\n \\n In my Cadillac. Good car to drive after a war\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I remember seein’ some ad\\n \\n So I turned on my Conelrad\\n \\n But I didn’t pay my Con Ed bill\\n \\n So the radio didn’t work so well\\n \\n Turned on my record player—\\n \\n It was Rock-a-day Johnny singin’, “Tell Your Ma, Tell Your Pa\\n \\n Our Love’s A-gonna Grow Ooh-wah, Ooh-wah”\\n \\n \\n \\n I was feelin’ kinda lonesome and blue\\n \\n I needed somebody to talk to\\n \\n So I called up the operator of time\\n \\n Just to hear a voice of some kind\\n \\n “When you hear the beep it will be three o’clock”\\n \\n She said that for over an hour\\n \\n And I hung up\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then\\n \\n Sayin’, “Hey I’ve been havin’ the same old dreams\\n \\n But mine was a little different you see\\n \\n I dreamt that the only person left after the war was me\\n \\n I didn’t see you around”\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, now time passed and now it seems\\n \\n Everybody’s having them dreams\\n \\n Everybody sees themselves\\n \\n Walkin’ around with no one else\\n \\n Half of the people can be part right all of the time\\n \\n Some of the people can be all right part of the time\\n \\n But all of the people can’t be all right all of the time\\n \\n I think Abraham Lincoln said that\\n \\n “I’ll let you be in my dreams if I can be in yours”\\n \\n I said that\\n\\nWell, I took me a woman late last night\\n \\n I’s three-fourths drunk, she looked uptight\\n \\n She took off her wheel, took off her bell\\n \\n Took off her wig, said, “How do I smell?\"\\n \\n I hot-footed it . . . bare-naked . . .\\n \\n Out the window!\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, sometimes I might get drunk\\n \\n Walk like a duck and stomp like a skunk\\n \\n Don’t hurt me none, don’t hurt my pride\\n \\n ’Cause I got my little lady right by my side\\n \\n (Right there\\n \\n Proud as can be)\\n \\n \\n \\n I’s out there paintin’ on the old woodshed\\n \\n When a can a black paint it fell on my head\\n \\n I went down to scrub and rub\\n \\n But I had to sit in back of the tub\\n \\n (Cost a quarter\\n \\n And I had to get out quick . . .\\n \\n Someone wanted to come in and take a sauna)\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, my telephone rang it would not stop\\n \\n It’s President Kennedy callin’ me up\\n \\n He said, “My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?”\\n \\n I said, “My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot\\n \\n Anita Ekberg\\n \\n Sophia Loren”\\n \\n (Put ’em all in the same room with Ernest Borgnine!)\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I got a woman sleeps on a cot\\n \\n She yells and hollers and squeals a lot\\n \\n Licks my face and tickles my ear\\n \\n Bends me over and buys me beer\\n \\n (She’s a honeymooner\\n \\n A June crooner\\n \\n A spoon feeder\\n \\n And a natural leader)\\n \\n \\n \\n Oh, there ain’t no use in me workin’ so heavy\\n \\n I got a woman who works on the levee\\n \\n Pumping that water up to her neck\\n \\n Every week she sends me a monthly check\\n \\n (She’s a humdinger\\n \\n Folk singer\\n \\n Dead ringer\\n \\n For a thing-a-muh jigger)\\n \\n \\n \\n Late one day in the middle of the week\\n \\n Eyes were closed I was half asleep\\n \\n I chased me a woman up the hill\\n \\n Right in the middle of an air-raid drill\\n \\n It was Little Bo Peep!\\n \\n (I jumped a fallout shelter\\n \\n I jumped a bean stalk\\n \\n I jumped a Ferris wheel)\\n \\n \\n \\n Now, the man on the stand he wants my vote\\n \\n He’s a-runnin’ for office on the ballot note\\n \\n He’s out there preachin’ in front of the steeple\\n \\n Tellin’ me he loves all kinds-a people\\n \\n (He’s eatin’ bagels\\n \\n He’s eatin’ pizza\\n \\n He’s eatin’ chitlins\\n \\n He’s eatin’ bullshit!)\\n \\n \\n \\n Oh, set me down on a television floor\\n \\n I’ll flip the channel to number four\\n \\n Out of the shower comes a grown-up man\\n \\n With a bottle of hair oil in his hand\\n \\n (It’s that greasy kid stuff\\n \\n What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is\\n \\n What do you do about Willy Mays and Yul Brynner\\n \\n Charles de Gaulle\\n \\n And Robert Louis Stevenson?)\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, the funniest woman I ever seen\\n \\n Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean\\n \\n She takes about fifteen baths a day\\n \\n Wants me to grow a cigar on my face\\n \\n (She’s a little bit heavy!)\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, ask me why I’m drunk alla time\\n \\n It levels my head and eases my mind\\n \\n I just walk along and stroll and sing\\n \\n I see better days and I do better things\\n \\n (I catch dinosaurs\\n \\n I make love to Elizabeth Taylor . . .\\n \\n Catch hell from Richard Burton!)\\n\\nWhile riding on a train goin’ west\\n \\n I fell asleep for to take my rest\\n \\n I dreamed a dream that made me sad\\n \\n Concerning myself and the first few friends I had\\n \\n \\n \\n With half-damp eyes I stared to the room\\n \\n Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon\\n \\n Where we together weathered many a storm\\n \\n Laughin’ and singin’ till the early hours of the morn\\n \\n \\n \\n By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung\\n \\n Our words were told, our songs were sung\\n \\n Where we longed for nothin’ and were quite satisfied\\n \\n Talkin’ and a-jokin’ about the world outside\\n \\n \\n \\n With haunted hearts through the heat and cold\\n \\n We never thought we could ever get old\\n \\n We thought we could sit forever in fun\\n \\n But our chances really was a million to one\\n \\n \\n \\n As easy it was to tell black from white\\n \\n It was all that easy to tell wrong from right\\n \\n And our choices were few and the thought never hit\\n \\n That the one road we traveled would ever shatter and split\\n \\n \\n \\n How many a year has passed and gone\\n \\n And many a gamble has been lost and won\\n \\n And many a road taken by many a friend\\n \\n And each one I’ve never seen again\\n \\n \\n \\n I wish, I wish, I wish in vain\\n \\n That we could sit simply in that room again\\n \\n Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat\\n \\n I’d give it all gladly if our lives could be like that\\n\\nHoney, just allow me one more chance\\n \\n To get along with you\\n \\n Honey, just allow me one more chance\\n \\n Ah’ll do anything with you\\n \\n Well, I’m a-walkin’ down the road\\n \\n With my head in my hand\\n \\n I’m lookin’ for a woman\\n \\n Needs a worried man\\n \\n Just-a one kind favor I ask you\\n \\n ’Low me just-a one more chance\\n \\n \\n \\n Honey, just allow me one more chance\\n \\n To ride your aeroplane\\n \\n Honey, just allow me one more chance\\n \\n To ride your passenger train\\n \\n Well, I’ve been lookin’ all over\\n \\n For a gal like you\\n \\n I can’t find nobody\\n \\n So you’ll have to do\\n \\n Just-a one kind favor I ask you\\n \\n ’Low me just-a one more chance\\n \\n \\n \\n Honey, just allow me one more chance\\n \\n To get along with you\\n \\n Honey, just allow me one more chance\\n \\n Ah’ll do anything with you\\n \\n Well, lookin’ for a woman\\n \\n That ain’t got no man\\n \\n Is just lookin’ for a needle\\n \\n That is lost in the sand\\n \\n Just-a one kind favor I ask you\\n \\n ’Low me just-a one more chance\\n\\nIt ain’t no use to sit and wonder why, babe\\n \\n It don’t matter, anyhow\\n \\n An’ it ain’t no use to sit and wonder why, babe\\n \\n If you don’t know by now\\n \\n

somethin’ you would do or say\\n \\n To try and make me change my mind and stay\\n \\n We never did too much talkin’ anyway\\n \\n So don’t think twice, it’s all right\\n \\n \\n \\n It ain’t no use in callin’ out my name, gal\\n \\n Like you never did before\\n \\n It ain’t no use in callin’ out my name, gal\\n \\n I can’t hear you anymore\\n \\n I’m a-thinkin’ and a-wond’rin’ all the way down the road\\n \\n I once loved a woman, a child I’m told\\n \\n I give her my heart but she wanted my soul\\n \\n But don’t think twice, it’s all right\\n \\n \\n \\n I’m walkin’ down that long, lonesome road, babe\\n \\n Where I’m bound, I can’t tell\\n \\n But goodbye’s too good a word, gal\\n \\n So I’ll just say fare thee well\\n \\n I ain’t sayin’ you treated me unkind\\n \\n You could have done better but I don’t mind\\n \\n You just kinda wasted my precious time\\n \\n But don’t think twice, it’s all right\\n\\nOld Reilly stole a stallion\\n\\nBut they caught him and they brought

by night and came by morning\\n\\nWith gold and silver in her hand\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the judge he saw Reilly’s daughter\\n\\nHis old eyes deepened in his head\\n\\nSayin’, “Gold will never free your

mornin’ she had awoken\\n\\nTo know that the judge had never spoken\\n\\nShe saw that hangin’ branch a-bendin’\\n\\nShe saw her father’s body broken\\n\\n\\n\\nThese be seven curses on a judge so

street\\n \\n The sidewalk and the sign\\n \\n And I’m one too many mornings\\n \\n An’ a thousand miles behind\\n \\n \\n \\n It’s a restless hungry feeling\\n \\n That don’t mean no one no good\\n \\n When ev’rything I’m a-sayin’\\n \\n You can say it just as good.\\n \\n You’re right from your side\\n \\n I’m right from mine\\n \\n We’re both just one too many mornings\\n \\n An’ a thousand miles behind\\n\\nCome gather ’round friends\\n \\n And I’ll tell you a tale\\n \\n Of when the red iron pits ran plenty\\n \\n But the cardboard filled windows\\n \\n And old men on the benches\\n \\n Tell you now that the whole town is empty\\n \\n \\n \\n In the north end of town\\n \\n My own children are grown\\n \\n But I was raised on the other\\n \\n In the wee hours of youth\\n \\n My mother took sick\\n \\n And I was brought up by my brother\\n \\n \\n \\n The iron ore poured\\n \\n As the years passed the door\\n \\n The drag lines an’ the shovels they was a-humming\\n \\n ’Til one day my brother\\n \\n Failed to come home\\n \\n The same as my father before him\\n \\n \\n \\n Well a long winter’s wait\\n \\n From the window I watched\\n \\n My friends they couldn’t have been kinder And my schooling was cut\\n \\n As I quit in the spring\\n \\n To marry John Thomas, a miner\\n \\n \\n \\n Oh the years passed again\\n \\n And the givin’ was good\\n \\n With the lunch bucket filled every season\\n \\n What with three babies born\\n \\n The work was cut down\\n \\n To a half a day’s shift with no reason\\n \\n \\n \\n Then the shaft was soon shut\\n \\n And more work was cut\\n \\n And the fire in the air, it felt frozen\\n \\n ’Til a man come to speak\\n \\n And he said in one week\\n \\n That number eleven was closin’\\n \\n \\n \\n They complained in the East\\n \\n They are paying too high\\n \\n They say that your ore ain’t worth digging\\n \\n That it’s much cheaper down\\n \\n In the South American towns\\n \\n Where the miners work almost for nothing\\n \\n \\n \\n So the mining gates locked\\n \\n And the red iron rotted\\n \\n And the room smelled heavy from drinking\\n \\n Where the sad, silent song\\n \\n Made the hour twice as long\\n \\n As I waited for the sun to go sinking\\n \\n \\n \\n I lived by the window\\n \\n As he talked to himself\\n \\n This silence of tongues it was building\\n \\n Then one morning’s wake\\n \\n The bed it was bare\\n \\n And I’s left alone with three children\\n \\n \\n \\n The summer is gone\\n \\n The ground’s turning cold\\n \\n The stores one by one they’re a-foldin’\\n \\n My children will go\\n \\n As soon as they grow\\n \\n Well, there ain’t nothing here now to hold them\\n\\nA bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers’ blood\\n \\n A finger fired the trigger to his name\\n \\n A handle hid out in the dark\\n \\n A hand set the spark\\n \\n Two eyes took the aim\\n \\n Behind a man’s brain\\n \\n But he can’t be blamed\\n \\n He’s only a pawn in their game\\n \\n \\n \\n A South politician preaches to the poor white man\\n \\n “You got more than the blacks, don’t complain\\n \\n You’re better than them, you been born with white skin,” they explain.\\n \\n And the Negro’s name\\n \\n Is used it is plain\\n \\n For the politician’s gain\\n \\n As he rises to fame\\n \\n And the poor white remains\\n \\n On the caboose of the train\\n \\n But it ain’t him to blame\\n \\n He’s only a pawn in their game\\n \\n \\n \\n The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid\\n \\n And the marshals and cops get the same\\n \\n But the poor white man’s used in the hands of them all like a tool\\n \\n He’s taught in his school\\n \\n From the start by the rule\\n \\n That the laws are with him\\n \\n To protect his white skin\\n \\n To keep up his hate\\n \\n So he never thinks straight\\n \\n ’Bout the shape that he’s in\\n \\n But it ain’t him to blame\\n \\n He’s only a pawn in their game\\n \\n \\n \\n From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks\\n \\n And the hoofbeats pound in his brain\\n \\n And he’s taught how to walk in a pack\\n \\n Shoot in the back\\n \\n With his fist in a clinch\\n \\n To hang and to lynch\\n \\n To hide ’neath the hood\\n \\n To kill with no pain\\n \\n Like a dog on a chain\\n \\n He ain’t got no name\\n \\n But it ain’t him to blame\\n \\n He’s only a pawn in their game.\\n \\n \\n \\n Today, Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught\\n \\n They lowered him down as a king\\n \\n But when the shadowy sun sets on the one\\n \\n That fired the gun\\n \\n He’ll see by his grave\\n \\n On the stone that remains\\n \\n Carved next to his name\\n \\n His epitaph plain:\\n \\n Only a pawn in their game\\n\\nOh, I’m sailin’ away my own true love\\n \\n I’m sailin’ away in the morning\\n \\n Is there something I can send you from across the sea\\n \\n From the place that I’ll be landing?\\n \\n \\n \\n No, there’s nothin’ you can send me, my own true love\\n \\n There’s nothin’ I wish to be ownin’\\n \\n Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled\\n \\n From across that lonesome ocean\\n \\n \\n \\n Oh, but I just thought you might want something fine\\n \\n Made of silver or of golden\\n \\n Either from the mountains of Madrid\\n \\n Or from the coast of Barcelona\\n \\n \\n \\n Oh, but if I had the stars from the darkest night\\n \\n And the diamonds from the deepest ocean\\n \\n I’d forsake them all for your sweet kiss\\n \\n For that’s all I’m wishin’ to be ownin’\\n \\n \\n \\n That I might be gone a long time\\n \\n And it’s only that I’m askin’\\n \\n Is there something I can send you to remember me by\\n \\n To make your time more easy passin’\\n \\n \\n \\n Oh, how can, how can you ask me again\\n \\n It only brings me sorrow\\n \\n The same thing I want from you today\\n \\n I would want again tomorrow\\n \\n \\n \\n I got a letter on a lonesome day\\n \\n It was from her ship a-sailin’\\n \\n Saying I don’t know when I’ll be comin’ back again\\n \\n It depends on how I’m a-feelin’\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, if you, my love, must think that-a-way\\n \\n I’m sure your mind is roamin’\\n \\n I’m sure your heart is not with me\\n \\n But with the country to where you’re goin’\\n \\n \\n \\n So take heed, take heed of the western wind\\n \\n Take heed of the stormy weather\\n \\n And yes, there’s something you can send back to me\\n \\n Spanish boots of Spanish leather\\n\\nOh my name it is nothin’\\n \\n My age it means less\\n \\n The country I come from\\n \\n Is called the Midwest\\n \\n I’s taught and brought up there\\n \\n The

fell\\n \\n The cavalries charged\\n \\n The Indians died\\n \\n Oh the country was young\\n \\n With God on its side\\n \\n \\n \\n Oh the Spanish-American\\n \\n War had its day\\n \\n And the Civil War too\\n \\n Was soon laid away\\n \\n And the names of the heroes\\n \\n l’s made to memorize\\n \\n With guns in their hands\\n \\n And God on their side\\n \\n \\n \\n Oh the First World War, boys\\n \\n It closed out its fate\\n \\n The reason for fighting\\n \\n I never got straight\\n \\n But I learned to accept it\\n \\n Accept it with pride\\n \\n For you don’t count the dead\\n \\n When God’s on your side\\n \\n \\n \\n When the Second World War\\n \\n Came to an end\\n \\n We forgave the Germans\\n \\n And we were friends\\n \\n Though they murdered six million\\n \\n In the ovens they fried\\n \\n The Germans now too\\n \\n Have God on their side\\n \\n \\n \\n I’ve learned to hate Russians\\n \\n All through my whole life\\n \\n If another war starts\\n \\n It’s them we must fight\\n \\n To hate them and fear them\\n \\n To run and to hide\\n \\n And accept it all bravely\\n \\n With God on my side\\n \\n \\n \\n But now we got weapons\\n \\n Of the chemical dust\\n \\n If fire them we’re forced to\\n \\n Then fire them we must\\n \\n One push of the button\\n \\n And a shot the world wide\\n \\n And you never ask questions\\n \\n When God’s on your side\\n \\n \\n \\n Through many dark hour\\n \\n I’ve been thinkin’ about this\\n \\n That Jesus Christ\\n \\n Was betrayed by a kiss\\n \\n But I can’t think for you\\n \\n You’ll have to decide\\n \\n Whether Judas Iscariot\\n \\n Had God on his side\\n \\n \\n \\n So now as I’m leavin’\\n \\n I’m weary as Hell\\n \\n The confusion I’m feelin’\\n \\n Ain’t no tongue can tell\\n \\n The words fill my head\\n \\n And fall to the floor\\n \\n If God’s on our side\\n \\n He’ll stop the next war\\n\\nWilliam Zanzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll\\n \\n With a cane that he twirled around his diamond

William Zanzinger for first-degree murder\\n \\n But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears\\n \\n Take the rag away from your face\\n \\n Now ain’t the time for your tears\\n \\n \\n \\n William Zanzinger, who at twenty-four years\\n \\n Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres\\n \\n With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him\\n \\n And high office relations in the politics of Maryland\\n \\n Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders\\n \\n And swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was snarling\\n \\n In a matter of minutes on bail was out

the kitchen\\n \\n She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children\\n \\n Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage\\n \\n And never sat once at the head of the table\\n \\n And didn’t even talk to the people at the table\\n \\n Who just cleaned up all the food from the table\\n \\n And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level\\n \\n Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane\\n \\n That sailed through the air and came down through the room\\n \\n Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle\\n \\n And she never done nothing to William Zanzinger\\n \\n But you who

sundown’s finish an’ midnight’s broken toll\\n \\n We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing\\n \\n As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds\\n \\n Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing\\n \\n Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight\\n \\n Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight\\n \\n An’ for each an’ ev’ry underdog soldier in the night\\n \\n An’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\\n \\n \\n \\n In the city’s melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched\\n \\n With faces hidden while the walls were tightening\\n \\n As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin’ rain\\n \\n Dissolved into the bells of the lightning\\n \\n Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake\\n \\n Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned an’ forsaked\\n \\n Tolling for the outcast, burnin’ constantly at stake\\n \\n An’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\\n \\n \\n \\n Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail\\n \\n The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder\\n \\n That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze\\n \\n Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder\\n \\n Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind\\n \\n Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind\\n \\n An’ the unpawned painter behind beyond his rightful time\\n \\n An’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\\n \\n \\n \\n Through the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales\\n \\n For the disrobed faceless forms of no position\\n \\n Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts\\n \\n All down in taken-for-granted situations\\n \\n Tolling for the deaf an’ blind, tolling for the mute\\n \\n Tolling for the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute\\n \\n For the misdemeanor outlaw, chased an’ cheated by pursuit\\n \\n An’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\\n \\n \\n \\n Even though a cloud’s white curtain in a far-off corner flashed\\n \\n An’ the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting\\n \\n Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones\\n \\n Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting\\n \\n Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail\\n \\n For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale\\n \\n An’ for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail\\n \\n An’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\\n \\n \\n \\n Starry-eyed an’ laughing as I recall when we were caught\\n \\n Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended\\n \\n As we listened one last time an’ we watched with one last look\\n \\n Spellbound an’ swallowed ’til the tolling ended\\n \\n Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed\\n \\n For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an’ worse\\n \\n An’ for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe\\n \\n An’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\\n\\nOh all the money that in my whole life I did spend\\n \\n Be it mine right or wrongfully\\n \\n I let it slip gladly past the hands of my friends\\n \\n To tie up the time most forcefully\\n \\n But the bottles are done\\n \\n We’ve killed each one\\n \\n And the table’s full and overflowed\\n \\n And the corner sign\\n \\n Says it’s closing time\\n \\n So I’ll bid farewell and be down the road\\n \\n \\n \\n Oh ev’ry girl that ever I’ve touched\\n \\n I did not do it harmfully\\n \\n And ev’ry girl that ever I’ve hurt\\n \\n I did not do it knowin’ly\\n \\n But to remain as friends\\n \\n And make amends\\n \\n You need the time and stay behind\\n \\n And since my feet are now fast\\n \\n And point away from the past\\n \\n I’ll bid farewell and be down the line\\n \\n \\n \\n Oh ev’ry foe that ever I faced\\n \\n The cause was there before we came\\n \\n And ev’ry cause that ever I fought\\n \\n I fought it full without regret or shame\\n \\n But the dark does die\\n \\n As the curtain is drawn and somebody’s eyes\\n \\n Must meet the dawn\\n \\n And if I see the day\\n \\n I’d only have to stay\\n \\n So I’ll bid farewell in the night and be gone\\n \\n \\n \\n Oh, ev’ry thought that’s strung a knot in my mind\\n \\n I might go insane if it couldn’t be sprung\\n \\n But it’s not to stand naked under unknowin’ eyes\\n \\n It’s for myself and my friends my stories are sung\\n \\n But the time ain’t tall, yet on time you depend\\n \\n And no word is possessed by no special friend\\n \\n And though the line is cut\\n \\n It ain’t quite the end\\n \\n I’ll just bid farewell till we meet again\\n \\n \\n \\n Oh a false clock tries to tick out my time\\n \\n To disgrace, distract, and bother me\\n \\n And the dirt of gossip blows into my face\\n \\n And the dust of rumors covers me\\n \\n But if the arrow is straight\\n \\n And the point is slick\\n \\n It can pierce through dust no matter how thick\\n \\n So I’ll make my stand\\n \\n And remain as I am\\n \\n And bid farewell and not give a damn\\n\\nI woke in the mornin’, wand’rin’\\n \\n Wasted and worn out\\n \\n I woke in the mornin’, wand’rin’\\n \\n Wasted and worn out\\n \\n Wishin’ my long-lost lover\\n \\n Will walk to me, talk to me\\n \\n Tell me what it’s all about\\n \\n \\n \\n I was standin’ at the side road\\n \\n Listenin’ to the billboard knock\\n \\n Standin’ at the side road\\n \\n Listenin’ to the billboard knock\\n \\n Well, my wrist was empty\\n \\n But my nerves were kickin’\\n \\n Tickin’ like a clock\\n \\n \\n \\n If I got anything you need, babe\\n \\n Let me tell you in front\\n \\n If I got anything you need, babe\\n \\n Let me tell you in front\\n \\n You can come to me sometime\\n \\n Night time, day time\\n \\n Any time you want\\n \\n \\n \\n Sometimes I’m thinkin’ I’m\\n \\n Too high to fall\\n \\n Sometimes I’m thinkin’ I’m\\n \\n Too high to fall\\n \\n Other times I’m thinkin’ I’m\\n \\n So low I don’t know\\n \\n

got me swallowed\\n \\n I have fallen far beneath\\n \\n Your pearly eyes, so fast an’ slashing\\n \\n An’ your flashing diamond teeth\\n \\n The night is pitch black, come an’ make my\\n \\n Pale face fit into place, ah, please!\\n \\n Let me know, babe, I’m nearly drowning\\n \\n If it’s you my lifelines trace\\n \\n \\n \\n I been wond’rin’ all about me\\n \\n Ever since I seen you there\\n \\n On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I’m riding\\n \\n I know I’m ’round you but I don’t know where\\n \\n You have slayed me, you have made me\\n \\n I got to laugh halfways off my heels\\n \\n I got to know, babe, will you surround me?\\n \\n So I can tell if I’m really real\\n\\nI once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze\\n \\n With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn\\n \\n I courted her proudly but now she is gone\\n \\n Gone as the season she’s taken\\n \\n \\n \\n Through young summer’s breeze, I stole her away\\n \\n From her mother and sister, though close did they stay\\n \\n Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day\\n \\n With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us\\n \\n \\n \\n Of the two sisters, I loved the young\\n \\n With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one\\n \\n The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone\\n \\n By the jealousy of others around her\\n \\n \\n \\n For her parasite sister, I had no respect\\n \\n Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect\\n \\n Countless visions of the other she’d reflect\\n \\n As a crutch for her scenes and her society\\n \\n \\n \\n Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused\\n \\n The changes I was going through can’t even be used\\n \\n For the lies that I told her in hopes not to lose\\n \\n The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime\\n \\n \\n \\n With unknown consciousness, I possessed in my grip\\n \\n A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped\\n \\n Noticing not that I’d already slipped\\n \\n To a sin of love’s false security\\n \\n \\n \\n From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace\\n \\n Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies\\n \\n Till the tombstones of damage read me no questions but, “Please\\n \\n What’s wrong and what’s exactly the matter?”\\n \\n \\n \\n And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen\\n \\n The timeless explosion of fantasy’s dream\\n \\n At the peak of the night, the king and the queen\\n \\n Tumbled all down into pieces\\n \\n \\n \\n “The tragic figure!” her sister did shout\\n \\n “Leave her alone, God damn you, get out!”\\n \\n And I in my armor, turning about\\n \\n And nailing her to the ruins of her pettiness\\n \\n \\n \\n Beneath a bare lightbulb the plaster did pound\\n \\n Her sister and I in a screaming battleground\\n \\n And she in between, the victim of sound\\n \\n Soon shattered as a child ’neath her shadows\\n \\n \\n \\n All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight\\n \\n I gagged twice, doubled, tears blinding my sight\\n \\n My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night\\n \\n Leaving all of love’s ashes behind me\\n \\n \\n \\n The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet\\n \\n The words to say I’m sorry, I haven’t found yet\\n \\n I think of her often and hope whoever she’s met\\n \\n Will be fully aware of how precious she is\\n \\n \\n \\n Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me\\n \\n “How good, how good does it feel to be free?”\\n \\n And I answer them most mysteriously\\n \\n “Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?”\\n\\nI’m just average, common too\\n \\n I’m just like him, the same as you\\n \\n I’m everybody’s brother and son\\n \\n I ain’t different from anyone\\n \\n It ain’t no use a-talking to me\\n \\n It’s just the same as talking to you\\n \\n \\n \\n I was shadow-boxing earlier in the day\\n \\n I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay\\n \\n I said “Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come\\n \\n 26, 27, 28, 29, I’m gonna make your face look just like mine\\n \\n Five, four, three, two, one, Cassius Clay you’d better run\\n \\n 99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won’t even recognize you\\n \\n 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen”\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I don’t know, but I’ve been told\\n \\n The streets in heaven are lined with gold\\n \\n I ask you how things could get much worse\\n \\n If the Russians happen to get up there first\\n \\n Wowee! pretty scary!\\n \\n \\n \\n Now, I’m liberal, but to a degree\\n \\n I want ev’rybody to be free\\n \\n But if you think that I’ll let Barry Goldwater\\n \\n Move in next door and marry my daughter\\n \\n You must think I’m crazy!\\n \\n I wouldn’t let him do it for all the farms in Cuba\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I set my monkey on the log\\n \\n And ordered him to do the Dog\\n \\n He wagged his tail and shook his head\\n \\n And he went and did the Cat instead\\n \\n He’s a weird monkey, very funky\\n \\n \\n \\n I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on\\n \\n Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun\\n \\n I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist\\n \\n And my wig-hat was falling in my face\\n \\n But they wouldn’t let me on the tennis court\\n \\n \\n \\n I got a woman, she’s so mean\\n \\n She sticks my boots in the washing machine\\n \\n Sticks me with buckshot when I’m nude\\n \\n Puts bubblegum in my food\\n \\n She’s funny, wants my money, calls me “honey”\\n \\n \\n \\n Now I got a friend who spends his life\\n \\n Stabbing my picture with a bowie knife\\n \\n Dreams of strangling me with a scarf\\n \\n When my name comes up he pretends to barf\\n \\n I’ve got a million friends!\\n \\n \\n \\n Now they asked me to read a poem\\n \\n At the sorority sisters’ home\\n \\n I got knocked down and my head was swimmin’\\n \\n I wound up with the Dean of Women\\n \\n Yippee! I’m a poet, and I know it\\n \\n Hope I don’t blow it\\n \\n \\n \\n I’m gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange\\n \\n So I look like a walking mountain range\\n \\n And I’m gonna ride into Omaha on a horse\\n \\n Out to the country club and the golf course\\n \\n Carry The New York Times, shoot a few holes, blow their minds\\n \\n \\n \\n Now you’re probably wondering by now\\n \\n Just what this song is all about\\n \\n What’s probably got you baffled more\\n \\n Is what this thing here is for\\n \\n It’s nothing\\n \\n It’s something I learned over in England\\n\\nRamona\\n \\n Come closer\\n \\n Shut softly your watery eyes\\n \\n The pangs of your sadness\\n \\n Shall pass as your senses will rise\\n \\n The flowers of the city\\n \\n Though breathlike\\n \\n Get deathlike at times\\n \\n And there’s no use in tryin’\\n \\n T’ deal with the dyin’\\n \\n Though I cannot explain that in lines\\n \\n \\n \\n Your cracked country lips\\n \\n I still wish to kiss\\n \\n As to be under the strength of your skin\\n \\n Your magnetic movements\\n \\n Still capture the minutes I’m in\\n \\n But it grieves my heart, love\\n \\n To see you tryin’ to be a part of\\n \\n A world that just don’t exist\\n \\n It’s all just a dream, babe\\n \\n A vacuum, a scheme, babe\\n \\n That sucks you into feelin’ like this\\n \\n \\n \\n I can see that your head\\n \\n Has been twisted and fed\\n \\n By worthless foam from the mouth\\n \\n I can tell you are torn\\n \\n Between stayin’ and returnin’\\n \\n On back to the South\\n \\n You’ve been fooled into thinking\\n \\n That the finishin’ end is at hand\\n \\n Yet there’s no one to beat you\\n \\n No one t’ defeat you\\n \\n ’Cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad\\n \\n \\n \\n I’ve heard you say many times\\n \\n That you’re better ’n no one\\n \\n And no one is better ’n you\\n \\n If you really believe that\\n \\n You know you got\\n \\n Nothing to win and nothing to lose\\n \\n From fixtures and forces and friends\\n \\n Your sorrow does stem\\n \\n That hype you and type you\\n \\n Making you feel\\n \\n That you must be exactly like them\\n \\n \\n \\n I’d forever talk to you\\n \\n But soon my words\\n \\n They would turn into a meaningless ring\\n \\n For deep in my heart\\n \\n I know there is no help I can bring\\n \\n Everything passes\\n \\n Everything changes\\n \\n Just do what you think you should do\\n \\n And someday maybe\\n \\n Who knows, baby\\n \\n I’ll come and be cryin’ to you\\n\\nI pounded on a farmhouse\\n \\n Lookin’ for a place to stay\\n \\n I was mighty, mighty tired\\n \\n I had come a long, long way\\n \\n I said, “Hey, hey, in there\\n \\n Is there anybody home?”\\n \\n I was standin’ on the steps\\n \\n Feelin’ most alone\\n \\n Well, out comes a farmer\\n \\n He must have thought that I was nuts\\n \\n He immediately looked at me\\n \\n And stuck a gun into my guts\\n \\n \\n \\n I fell down\\n \\n To my bended knees\\n \\n Saying, “I dig farmers\\n \\n Don’t shoot me, please!”\\n \\n He cocked his rifle\\n \\n And began to shout\\n \\n “You’re that travelin’ salesman\\n \\n That I have heard about”\\n \\n I said, “No! No! No!\\n \\n I’m a doctor and it’s true\\n \\n I’m a clean-cut kid\\n \\n And I been to college, too”\\n \\n \\n \\n Then in comes his daughter\\n \\n Whose name was Rita\\n \\n She looked like she stepped out of\\n \\n La Dolce Vita\\n \\n I immediately tried to cool it\\n \\n With her dad\\n \\n And told him what a\\n \\n Nice, pretty farm he had\\n \\n He said, “What do doctors\\n \\n Know about farms, pray tell?”\\n \\n I said, “I was born\\n \\n At the bottom of a wishing well”\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, by the dirt ’neath my nails\\n \\n I guess he knew I wouldn’t lie\\n \\n “I guess you’re tired”\\n \\n He said, kinda sly\\n \\n I said, “Yes, ten thousand miles\\n \\n Today I drove”\\n \\n He said, “I got a bed for you\\n \\n Underneath the stove\\n \\n Just one condition\\n \\n And you go to sleep right now\\n \\n That you don’t touch my daughter\\n \\n And in the morning, milk the cow”\\n \\n \\n \\n I was sleepin’ like a rat\\n \\n When I heard something jerkin’\\n \\n There stood Rita\\n \\n Lookin’ just like Tony Perkins\\n \\n She said, “Would you like to take a shower?\\n \\n I’ll show you up to the door”\\n \\n I said, “Oh, no! no!\\n \\n I’ve been through this before”\\n \\n I knew I had to split\\n \\n But I didn’t know how\\n \\n When she said\\n \\n “Would you like to take that shower, now?”\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I couldn’t leave\\n \\n Unless the old man chased me out\\n \\n ’Cause I’d already promised\\n \\n That I’d milk his cows\\n \\n I had to say something\\n \\n To strike him very weird\\n \\n So I yelled out\\n \\n “I like Fidel Castro and his beard”\\n \\n Rita looked offended\\n \\n But she got out of the way\\n \\n As he came charging down the stairs\\n \\n Sayin’, “What’s that I heard you say?”\\n \\n \\n \\n I said, “I like Fidel Castro\\n \\n I think you heard me right”\\n \\n And ducked as he swung\\n \\n At me with all his might\\n \\n Rita mumbled something\\n \\n ’Bout her mother on the hill\\n \\n As his fist hit the icebox\\n \\n He said he’s going to kill me\\n \\n If I don’t get out the door\\n \\n In two seconds flat\\n \\n “You unpatriotic\\n \\n Rotten doctor Commie rat”\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, he threw a Reader’s Digest\\n \\n At my head and I did run\\n \\n I did a somersault\\n \\n As I seen him get his gun\\n \\n And crashed through the window\\n \\n At a hundred miles an hour\\n \\n And landed fully blast\\n \\n In his garden flowers\\n \\n Rita said, “Come back!”\\n \\n As he started to load\\n \\n The sun was comin’ up\\n \\n And I was runnin’ down the road\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I don’t figure I’ll be back\\n \\n There for a spell\\n \\n Even though Rita moved away\\n \\n And got a job in a motel\\n \\n He still waits for me\\n \\n Constant, on the sly\\n \\n He wants to turn me in\\n \\n To the F.B.I.\\n \\n Me, I romp and stomp\\n \\n Thankful as I romp\\n \\n Without freedom of speech\\n \\n I might be in the swamp\\n\\nI can’t understand\\n \\n She let go of my hand\\n \\n An’ left me here facing the wall\\n \\n I’d sure like t’ know\\n \\n Why she did go\\n \\n But I can’t get close t’ her at all\\n \\n Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime\\n \\n She said she would never forget\\n \\n But now mornin’s clear\\n \\n It’s like I ain’t here\\n \\n She just acts like we never have met\\n \\n \\n \\n It’s all new t’ me\\n \\n Like some mystery\\n \\n It could even be like a myth\\n \\n Yet it’s hard t’ think on\\n \\n That she’s the same one\\n \\n That last night I was with\\n \\n From darkness, dreams’re deserted\\n \\n Am I still dreamin’ yet?\\n \\n I wish she’d unlock\\n \\n Her voice once an’ talk\\n \\n ’Stead of acting like we never have met\\n \\n \\n \\n If she ain’t feelin’ well\\n \\n Then why don’t she tell\\n \\n ’Stead of turnin’ her back t’ my face?\\n \\n Without any doubt\\n \\n She seems too far out\\n \\n For me t’ return t’ her chase\\n \\n Though the night ran swirling an’ whirling\\n \\n I remember her whispering yet\\n \\n But evidently she don’t\\n \\n An’ evidently she won’t\\n \\n She just acts like we never have met\\n \\n \\n \\n If I didn’t have t’ guess\\n \\n I’d gladly confess\\n \\n T’ anything I might’ve tried\\n \\n If I was with ’er too long\\n \\n Or have done something wrong\\n \\n I wish she’d tell me what it is, I’ll run an’ hide\\n \\n Though her skirt it swayed as a guitar played\\n \\n Her mouth was watery and wet\\n \\n But now something has changed\\n \\n For she ain’t the same\\n \\n She just acts like we never have met\\n \\n \\n \\n I’m leavin’ today\\n \\n I’ll be on my way\\n \\n Of this I can’t say very much\\n \\n But if you want me to\\n \\n I can be just like you\\n \\n An’ pretend that we never have touched\\n \\n An’ if anybody asks me\\n \\n “Is it easy to forget?”\\n \\n I’ll say, “It’s easily done\\n \\n You just pick anyone\\n \\n An’ pretend that you never have met!”\\n\\nCome gather ’round people\\n \\n Wherever you roam\\n \\n And admit that the waters\\n \\n Around you have grown\\n \\n And accept it that soon\\n \\n You’ll be drenched to the bone\\n \\n If your time to you is worth savin’\\n \\n Then you better start swimmin’ or you’ll sink like a stone\\n \\n For the times they are a-changin’\\n \\n \\n \\n Come writers and critics\\n \\n Who prophesize with your pen\\n \\n And keep your eyes wide\\n \\n The chance won’t come again\\n \\n And don’t speak too soon\\n \\n For the wheel’s still in spin\\n \\n And there’s no tellin’ who that it’s namin’\\n \\n For the loser now will be later to win\\n \\n For the times they are

Please get out of the new one if you can’t lend your hand\\n \\n For the times they are a-changin’\\n \\n \\n \\n The line it is drawn\\n \\n The curse it is cast\\n \\n The slow one now\\n \\n Will later be fast\\n \\n As the present now\\n \\n Will later be past\\n \\n The order is rapidly fadin’\\n \\n And the first one now will later be last\\n \\n For the times they are a-changin’\\n\\nYou walk into the room\\n \\n With your pencil in your hand\\n \\n You see somebody naked\\n \\n And you say, “Who is that man?”\\n \\n You try so hard\\n \\n But you don’t understand\\n \\n Just what you’ll say\\n \\n When you get home\\n \\n \\n \\n Because something is happening here\\n \\n But you don’t know what it is\\n \\n Do you, Mister Jones?\\n \\n \\n \\n You raise up your head\\n \\n And you ask, “Is this where it is?”\\n \\n And somebody points to you and says\\n \\n “It’s his”\\n \\n And you say, “What’s mine?”\\n \\n And somebody else says, “Where what is?”\\n \\n And you say, “Oh my God\\n \\n Am I here all alone?”\\n \\n \\n \\n Because something is happening here\\n \\n But you don’t know what it is\\n \\n Do you, Mister Jones?\\n \\n \\n \\n You hand in your ticket\\n \\n And you go watch the geek\\n \\n Who immediately walks up to you\\n \\n When he hears you speak\\n \\n And says, “How does it feel\\n \\n To be such a freak?”\\n \\n And you say, “Impossible”\\n \\n As he hands you a bone\\n \\n \\n \\n Because something is happening here\\n \\n But you don’t know what it is\\n \\n Do you, Mister Jones?\\n \\n \\n \\n You have many contacts\\n \\n Among the lumberjacks\\n \\n To get you facts\\n \\n When someone attacks your imagination\\n \\n But nobody has any respect\\n \\n Anyway they already expect you\\n \\n To just give a check\\n \\n To tax-deductible charity organizations\\n \\n \\n \\n You’ve been with the professors\\n \\n And they’ve all liked your looks\\n \\n With great lawyers you have\\n \\n Discussed lepers and crooks\\n \\n You’ve been through all of\\n \\n F.

\\n \\n Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you\\n \\n And then he kneels\\n \\n He crosses himself\\n \\n And then he clicks his high heels\\n \\n And without further notice\\n \\n He asks you how it feels\\n \\n And he says, “Here is your throat back\\n \\n Thanks for the loan”\\n \\n \\n \\n Because something is happening here\\n \\n But you don’t know what it is\\n \\n Do you, Mister Jones?\\n \\n \\n \\n Now you see this one-eyed midget\\n \\n Shouting the word “NOW”\\n \\n And you say, “For what reason?”\\n \\n And he says, “How?”\\n \\n And you say, “What does this mean?”\\n \\n And he screams back, “You’re a cow\\n \\n Give me some milk\\n \\n Or else go home”\\n \\n \\n \\n Because something is happening here\\n \\n But you don’t know what it is\\n \\n Do you, Mister Jones?\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, you walk into the room\\n \\n Like a camel and then you frown\\n \\n You put your eyes in your pocket\\n \\n And your nose on the ground\\n \\n There ought to be a law\\n \\n Against you comin’ around\\n \\n You should be made\\n \\n To wear earphones\\n \\n \\n \\n Because something is happening here\\n \\n But you don’t know what it is\\n \\n Do you, Mister

rain\\n \\n And the Good Samaritan, he’s dressing\\n \\n He’s getting ready for the show\\n \\n He’s going to the carnival tonight\\n \\n On Desolation Row\\n \\n \\n \\n Now Ophelia, she’s ’neath the window\\n \\n For her I feel so afraid\\n \\n On her twenty-second birthday\\n \\n She already is an old maid\\n \\n To her, death is quite romantic\\n \\n She wears an iron vest\\n \\n Her profession’s her religion\\n \\n Her sin is her lifelessness\\n \\n And though her eyes are fixed upon\\n \\n Noah’s great rainbow\\n \\n She spends her time peeking\\n \\n Into Desolation Row\\n \\n \\n \\n Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood\\n \\n With his memories in a trunk\\n \\n Passed this way an hour ago\\n \\n With his friend, a jealous monk\\n \\n He looked so immaculately frightful\\n \\n As he bummed a cigarette\\n \\n Then he went off sniffing drainpipes\\n \\n And reciting the alphabet\\n \\n Now you would not think to look at him\\n \\n But he was famous long ago\\n \\n For playing the electric violin\\n \\n On Desolation Row\\n \\n \\n \\n Dr. Filth, he keeps his world\\n \\n Inside of a leather cup\\n \\n But all his sexless patients\\n \\n They’re trying to blow it up\\n \\n Now his nurse, some local loser\\n \\n She’s in charge of the cyanide hole\\n \\n And she also keeps the cards that read\\n \\n “Have Mercy on His Soul”\\n \\n They all play on pennywhistles\\n \\n You can hear them blow\\n \\n If you lean your head out far enough\\n \\n From Desolation Row\\n \\n \\n \\n Across the street they’ve nailed the curtains\\n \\n They’re getting ready for the feast\\n \\n The Phantom of the Opera\\n \\n A perfect image of a priest\\n \\n They’re spoonfeeding Casanova\\n \\n To get him to feel more assured\\n \\n Then they’ll kill him with self-confidence\\n \\n After poisoning him with words\\n \\n And the Phantom’s shouting to skinny girls\\n \\n “Get Outa Here If You Don’t Know\\n \\n Casanova is just being punished for going\\n \\n To Desolation Row”\\n \\n \\n \\n Now at midnight all the agents\\n \\n And the superhuman crew\\n \\n Come out and round up everyone\\n \\n That knows more than they do\\n \\n Then they bring them to the factory\\n \\n Where the heart-attack machine\\n \\n Is strapped across their shoulders\\n \\n And then the kerosene\\n \\n Is brought down from the castles\\n \\n By insurance men who go\\n \\n Check to see that nobody is escaping\\n \\n To Desolation Row\\n \\n \\n \\n Praise be to Nero’s Neptune\\n \\n The Titanic sails at dawn\\n \\n And everybody’s shouting\\n \\n “Which Side Are You On?”\\n \\n And Ezra Pound and T. S.

And nobody has to think too much\\n \\n About Desolation Row\\n \\n \\n \\n Yes, I received your letter yesterday\\n \\n (About the time the doorknob broke)\\n \\n When you asked how I was doing\\n \\n Was that some kind of joke?\\n \\n All these people that you mention\\n \\n Yes, I know them, they’re quite lame\\n \\n I had to rearrange their faces\\n \\n And give them all another name\\n \\n Right now I can’t read too good\\n \\n Don’t send me no more letters no\\n \\n Not unless you mail them\\n \\n From Desolation Row\\n\\nI got this graveyard woman, you know she keeps my kid\\n \\n But my soulful mama, you know she keeps me hid\\n \\n She’s a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread\\n \\n Well, if I go down dyin’, you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed.\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I’m lost on the river bridge\\n \\n I’m cracked up on the highway and on the water’s edge\\n \\n She comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with thread\\n \\n Well, if I go down dyin’, you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed.\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, she don’t make me nervous, she don’t talk too much\\n \\n She walks like Bo Diddley and she don’t need no crutch\\n \\n She keeps this four-ten all loaded with lead\\n \\n Well, if I go down dyin’, you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed.\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, you know I need a steam shovel mama to keep away the dead\\n \\n I need a dump truck mama to unload my head\\n \\n She brings me everything and more, and just like I said\\n \\n Well, if I go down dyin’, you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed.\\n\\nI paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents\\n\\nI paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents\\n\\nSee my hound dog bite a rabbit\\n\\nAnd my football’s sittin’ on a barbed-wire fence\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, my temperature rises and my feet don’t walk so fast\\n\\nYes, my temperature rises and my feet don’t walk so fast\\n\\nWell, this Arabian doctor came in, gave me a shot\\n\\nBut wouldn’t tell me if what I had would last\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, this woman I’ve got, she’s filling me with her drive\\n\\nYes, this woman I’ve got, she’s thrillin’ me with her hive\\n\\nShe’s calling me Stan\\n\\nOr else she calls me Mister Clive\\n\\n\\n\\nOf course, you’re gonna think this song is a riff\\n\\nI know you’re gonna

yuh understand\\n \\n Who came running to the deck\\n \\n Said, “Boys, forget the whale\\n \\n Look on over yonder\\n \\n Cut the engines\\n \\n Change the sail\\n \\n Haul on the bowline”\\n \\n We sang that melody\\n \\n Like all tough sailors do\\n \\n When they are far away at sea\\n \\n \\n \\n “I think I’ll call it America”\\n \\n I said as we hit land\\n \\n I took a deep breath\\n \\n I fell down, I could not stand\\n \\n Captain Arab he started\\n \\n Writing up some deeds\\n \\n He said, “Let’s set up a fort\\n \\n And start buying the place with beads”\\n \\n Just then this cop comes down the street\\n \\n Crazy as a loon\\n \\n He throw us all in jail\\n \\n For carryin’ harpoons\\n \\n \\n \\n Ah me I busted out\\n \\n Don’t even ask me how\\n \\n I went to get some help\\n \\n I walked by a Guernsey cow\\n \\n Who directed me down\\n \\n To the Bowery slums\\n \\n Where people carried signs around\\n \\n Saying, “Ban the bums”\\n \\n I jumped right into line\\n \\n Sayin’, “I hope that I’m not late”\\n \\n When I realized I hadn’t eaten\\n \\n For five days straight\\n \\n \\n \\n I went into a restaurant\\n \\n Lookin’ for the cook\\n \\n I told them I was the editor\\n \\n Of a famous etiquette book\\n \\n The waitress he was handsome\\n \\n He wore a powder blue cape\\n \\n I ordered some suzette, I said\\n \\n “Could you please make that crepe”\\n \\n Just then the whole kitchen exploded\\n \\n From boilin’ fat\\n \\n Food was flying everywhere\\n \\n And I left without my hat\\n \\n \\n \\n Now, I didn’t mean to be nosy\\n \\n But I went into a bank\\n \\n To get some bail for Arab\\n \\n And all the boys back in the tank\\n \\n They asked me for some collateral\\n \\n And I pulled down my pants\\n \\n They threw me in the alley\\n \\n When up comes this girl from France\\n \\n Who invited me to her house\\n \\n I went, but she had a friend\\n \\n Who knocked me out\\n \\n And robbed my boots\\n \\n And I was on the street again\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I rapped upon a house\\n \\n With the U.S. flag upon display\\n \\n I said, “Could you help me out\\n \\n I got some friends down the way”\\n \\n The man says, “Get out of here\\n \\n I’ll tear you limb from limb”\\n \\n I said, “You know they refused Jesus, too”\\n \\n He said, “You’re not Him\\n \\n Get out of here before I break your bones\\n \\n I ain’t your pop”\\n \\n I decided to have him arrested\\n \\n And I went looking for a cop\\n \\n \\n \\n I ran right outside\\n \\n And I hopped inside a cab\\n \\n I went out the other door\\n \\n This Englishman said, “Fab”\\n \\n As he saw me leap a hot dog stand\\n \\n And a chariot that stood\\n \\n Parked across from a building\\n \\n Advertising brotherhood\\n \\n I ran right through the front door\\n \\n Like a hobo sailor does\\n \\n But it was just a funeral parlor\\n \\n And the man asked me who I was\\n \\n \\n \\n I repeated that my friends\\n \\n Were all in jail, with a sigh\\n \\n He gave me his card\\n \\n He said, “Call me if they die”\\n \\n I shook his hand and said goodbye\\n \\n Ran out to the street\\n \\n When a bowling ball came down the road\\n \\n And knocked me off my feet\\n \\n A pay phone was ringing\\n \\n It just about blew my mind\\n \\n When I picked it up and said hello\\n \\n This foot came through the line\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, by this time I was fed up\\n \\n At tryin’ to make a stab\\n \\n At bringin’ back any help\\n \\n For my friends and Captain Arab\\n \\n I decided to flip a coin\\n \\n Like either heads or tails\\n \\n Would let me know if I should go\\n \\n Back to ship or back to jail\\n \\n So I hocked my sailor suit\\n \\n And I got a coin to flip\\n \\n It came up tails\\n \\n It rhymed with sails\\n \\n So I made it back to the ship\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I got back and took\\n \\n The parkin’ ticket off the mast\\n \\n I was ripping it to shreds\\n \\n When this coastguard boat went past\\n \\n They asked me my name\\n \\n And I said, “Captain Kidd”\\n \\n They believed me but\\n \\n They wanted to know\\n \\n What exactly that I did\\n \\n I said for the Pope of Eruke\\n \\n I was employed\\n \\n They let me go right away\\n \\n They were very paranoid\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, the last I heard of Arab\\n \\n He was stuck on a whale\\n \\n That was married to the deputy\\n \\n Sheriff of the jail\\n \\n But the funniest thing was\\n \\n When I was leavin’ the bay\\n \\n I saw three ships a-sailin’\\n \\n They were all heading my way\\n \\n I asked the captain what his name was\\n \\n And how come he didn’t drive a truck\\n \\n He said his name was Columbus\\n \\n I just said, “Good luck”\\n\\nI ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more\\n \\n No, I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more\\n \\n Well, I wake in the morning\\n \\n Fold my hands and pray for rain\\n \\n I got a head full of ideas\\n \\n That are drivin’ me insane\\n \\n It’s a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor\\n \\n I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more\\n \\n \\n \\n I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s brother no more\\n \\n No, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s brother no more\\n \\n Well, he hands you a nickel\\n \\n He hands you a dime\\n \\n He asks you with a grin\\n \\n If you’re havin’ a good time\\n \\n Then he fines you every time you slam the door\\n \\n I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s brother no more\\n \\n \\n \\n I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s pa no more\\n \\n No, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s pa no more\\n \\n Well, he puts his cigar\\n \\n Out in your face just for kicks\\n \\n His bedroom window\\n \\n It is made out of bricks\\n \\n The National Guard stands around his door\\n \\n Ah, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s pa no more\\n \\n \\n \\n I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s ma no more\\n \\n No, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s ma no more\\n \\n Well, she talks to all the servants\\n \\n About man and God and law\\n \\n Everybody says\\n \\n She’s the brains behind pa\\n \\n She’s sixty-eight, but she says she’s twenty-four\\n \\n I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s ma no more\\n \\n \\n \\n I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more\\n \\n No, I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more\\n \\n Well, I try my best\\n \\n To be just like I am\\n \\n But everybody wants you\\n \\n To be just like them\\n \\n They sing while you slave and I just get bored\\n \\n I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more\\n\\nWhen she said\\n \\n “Don’t waste your words, they’re just lies”\\n \\n I cried she was deaf\\n \\n And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes\\n \\n Then said, “What else you got left?”\\n \\n It was then that I got up to leave\\n \\n But she said, “Don’t forget\\n \\n Everybody must give something back\\n \\n For something they get”\\n \\n \\n \\n I stood there and hummed\\n \\n I tapped on her drum and asked her how come\\n \\n And she buttoned her boot\\n \\n And straightened her suit\\n \\n Then she said, “Don’t get cute”\\n \\n So I forced my hands in my pockets\\n \\n And felt with my thumbs\\n \\n And gallantly handed her\\n \\n My very last piece of gum\\n \\n \\n \\n She threw me outside\\n \\n I stood in the dirt where ev’ryone walked\\n \\n And after finding I’d\\n \\n Forgotten my shirt\\n \\n I went back and knocked\\n \\n I waited in the hallway, she went to get it\\n \\n And I tried to make sense\\n \\n Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair\\n \\n That leaned up against . . .\\n \\n \\n \\n Her Jamaican rum\\n \\n And when she did come, I asked her for some\\n \\n She said, “No, dear”\\n \\n I said, “Your words aren’t clear\\n \\n You’d better spit out your gum”\\n \\n She screamed till her face got so red\\n \\n Then she fell on the floor\\n \\n And I covered her up and then\\n \\n Thought I’d go look through her drawer\\n \\n \\n \\n And when I was through\\n \\n I filled up my shoe\\n \\n And brought it to you\\n \\n And you, you took me in\\n \\n You loved me then\\n \\n You didn’t waste time\\n \\n And I, I never took much\\n \\n I never asked for your crutch\\n \\n Now don’t ask for mine\\n\\nEarly in the mornin’\\n \\n Early in the mornin’\\n \\n I’m callin’ you to\\n \\n I’m callin’ you to\\n \\n Please come home\\n \\n Yes, I guess I could make it without you\\n \\n If I just didn’t feel so all alone\\n \\n \\n \\n Don’t let me down\\n \\n Don’t let me down\\n \\n I won’t let you down\\n \\n I won’t let you down\\n \\n No I won’t\\n \\n You know I can if you can, honey\\n \\n But, honey, please don’t\\n \\n \\n \\n I got my black dog barkin’\\n \\n Black dog barkin’\\n \\n Yes it is now\\n \\n Yes it is now\\n \\n Outside my yard\\n \\n Yes, I could tell you what he means\\n \\n If I just didn’t have to try so hard\\n \\n \\n \\n Your mama’s workin’\\n \\n Your mama’s moanin’\\n \\n She’s cryin’ you know\\n \\n She’s tryin’ you know\\n \\n You better go now\\n \\n Well, I’d tell you what she wants\\n \\n But I just don’t know how\\n \\n \\n \\n Fifteen jugglers\\n \\n Fifteen jugglers\\n \\n Five believers\\n \\n Five believers\\n \\n All dressed like men\\n \\n Tell yo’ mama not to worry because\\n \\n They’re just my friends\\n \\n \\n \\n Early in the mornin’\\n \\n Early in the mornin’\\n \\n I’m callin’ you to\\n \\n I’m callin’ you to\\n \\n Please come home\\n \\n Yes, I could make it without you\\n \\n If I just did not feel so all alone\\n\\nWell, your railroad gate, you know I just can’t jump it\\n \\n Sometimes it gets so hard, you see\\n \\n I’m just sitting here beating on my trumpet\\n \\n With all these promises you left for me\\n \\n But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I waited for you when I was half sick\\n \\n Yes, I waited for you when you hated me\\n \\n Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic\\n \\n When you knew I had some other place to be\\n \\n Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously\\n \\n But then, now again, not too many can be like you, fortunately\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, six white horses that you did promise\\n \\n Were fin’lly delivered down to the penitentiary\\n \\n But to live outside the law, you must be honest\\n \\n I know you always say that you agree\\n \\n But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I don’t know how it happened\\n \\n But the riverboat captain, he knows my fate\\n \\n But ev’rybody else, even yourself\\n \\n They’re just gonna have to wait\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I got the fever down in my pockets\\n \\n The Persian drunkard, he follows me\\n \\n Yes, I can take him to your house but I can’t unlock it\\n \\n You see, you forgot to leave me with the key\\n \\n Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?\\n \\n \\n \\n Now, I been in jail when all my mail showed\\n \\n That a man can’t give his address out to bad company\\n \\n And now I stand here lookin’ at your yellow railroad\\n \\n In the ruins of your balcony\\n \\n Wond’ring where you are tonight, sweet Marie\\n\\nThe pawnbroker roared\\n\\nAlso, so, so did the landlord\\n\\nThe scene was so crazy, wasn’t it?\\n\\nBoth were so glad\\n\\nTo watch me destroy what I had\\n\\nPain sure brings out the best in people, doesn’t it?\\n\\nWhy didn’t you just leave me if you didn’t want to stay?\\n\\nWhy’d you have to treat me so bad?\\n\\nDid it have to be that way?\\n\\nNow you stand here expectin’ me to remember somethin’ you forgot to say\\n\\nYes, and you, I see you’re still with her, well\\n\\nThat’s fine ’cause she’s comin’ on so strange, can’t you tell?\\n\\nSomebody had better explain\\n\\nShe’s got her iron chain\\n\\nI’d do it, but I, I just can’t remember how\\n\\nYou talk to her\\n\\nShe’s your lover now\\n\\n\\n\\nI already assumed\\n\\nThat we’re in the felony room\\n\\nBut I ain’t a judge, you don’t have to be nice to me\\n\\nBut please tell that\\n\\nTo your friend in the cowboy hat\\n\\nYou know he keeps on sayin’ ev’rythin’ twice to me\\n\\nYou know I was straight with you\\n\\nYou know I’ve never tried to change you in any way\\n\\nYou know if you didn’t want to be with me\\n\\nThat you could . . . didn’t have to stay\\n\\nNow you stand here sayin’ you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?\\n\\nYes, you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays, can’t you reach?\\n\\nI see you kiss her on the cheek ev’rytime she gives a speech\\n\\nWith her picture books of the pyramid\\n\\nAnd her postcards of Billy the Kid (why must everybody bow?)\\n\\nYou better talk to her ’bout it\\n\\nYou’re her lover now\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, ev’rybody that cares\\n\\nIs goin’ up the castle stairs\\n\\nBut I’m not up in your castle, honey\\n\\nIt’s true, I just can’t recall\\n\\nSan Francisco at all\\n\\nI can’t even remember El Paso, uh, honey\\n\\nYou never had to be faithful\\n\\nI didn’t want you to grieve\\n\\nOh, why was it so hard for you\\n\\nIf you didn’t want to be with me, just to leave?\\n\\nNow you stand here while your finger’s goin’ up my sleeve\\n\\nAn’ you, just what do you do anyway? Ain’t there nothin’ you can say?\\n\\nShe’ll be standin’ on the bar soon\\n\\nWith a fish head an’ a harpoon\\n\\nAn’ a fake beard plastered on her brow\\n\\nYou’d better do somethin’ quick\\n\\nShe’s your lover now\\n\\n\\nThe guilty undertaker sighs\\n \\n The lonesome organ grinder cries\\n \\n The silver saxophones say I should refuse you\\n \\n The cracked bells and washed-out horns\\n \\n Blow into my face with scorn\\n \\n But it’s not that way\\n \\n I wasn’t born to lose you\\n \\n \\n \\n I want you, I want you\\n \\n I want you so bad\\n \\n Honey, I want you\\n \\n \\n \\n The drunken politician leaps\\n \\n Upon the street where mothers weep\\n \\n And the saviors who are fast asleep, they wait for you\\n \\n And I wait for them to interrupt\\n \\n Me drinkin’ from my broken cup\\n \\n And ask me to\\n \\n Open up the gate for you\\n \\n \\n \\n I want you, I want you\\n \\n I want you so bad\\n \\n Honey, I want you\\n \\n \\n \\n How all my fathers, they’ve gone down\\n \\n True love they’ve been without it\\n \\n But all their daughters put me down\\n \\n ’Cause I don’t think about it\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I return to the Queen of Spades\\n \\n And talk with my chambermaid\\n \\n She knows that I’m not afraid to look at her\\n \\n She is good to me\\n \\n And there’s nothing she doesn’t see\\n \\n She knows where I’d like to be\\n \\n But it doesn’t matter\\n \\n \\n \\n I want you, I want you\\n \\n I want you so bad\\n \\n Honey, I want you\\n \\n \\n \\n Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit\\n \\n He spoke to me, I took his flute\\n \\n No, I wasn’t very cute to him, was I?\\n \\n But I did it, though, because he lied\\n \\n Because he took you for a ride\\n \\n And because time was on his side\\n \\n And because I . . .\\n \\n \\n \\n I want you, I want you\\n \\n I want you so bad\\n \\n Honey, I want you\\n\\nWith your mercury mouth in the missionary times\\n \\n And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes\\n \\n And your silver cross, and your voice like chimes\\n \\n Oh, who among them do they think could bury you?\\n \\n With your pockets well protected at last\\n \\n And your streetcar visions which you place on the grass\\n \\n And your flesh like silk, and your face like glass\\n \\n Who among them do they think could carry you?\\n \\n Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands\\n \\n Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes\\n \\n My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums\\n \\n Should I leave them by your gate\\n \\n Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?\\n \\n \\n \\n With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace\\n \\n And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace\\n \\n And your basement clothes and your hollow face\\n \\n Who among them can think he could outguess you?\\n \\n With your silhouette when the sunlight dims\\n \\n Into your eyes where the moonlight swims\\n \\n And your matchbook songs and your gypsy hymns\\n \\n Who among them would try to impress you?\\n \\n Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands\\n \\n Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes\\n \\n My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums\\n \\n Should I leave them by your gate\\n \\n Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?\\n \\n \\n \\n The kings of Tyrus with their convict list\\n \\n Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss\\n \\n And you wouldn’t know it would happen like this\\n \\n But who among them really wants just to kiss you?\\n \\n With your childhood flames on your midnight rug\\n \\n And your Spanish manners and your mother’s drugs\\n \\n And your cowboy mouth and your curfew plugs\\n \\n Who among them do you think could resist you?\\n \\n Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands\\n \\n Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes\\n \\n My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums\\n \\n Should I leave them by your gate\\n \\n Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?\\n \\n \\n \\n Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide\\n \\n To show you the dead angels that they used to hide\\n \\n But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?\\n \\n Oh, how could they ever mistake you?\\n \\n They wished you’d accepted the blame for the farm\\n \\n But with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm\\n \\n And with the child of a hoodlum wrapped up in your arms\\n \\n How could they ever, ever persuade you?\\n \\n Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands\\n \\n Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes\\n \\n My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums\\n \\n Should I leave them by your gate\\n \\n Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?\\n \\n \\n \\n With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row\\n \\n And your magazine-husband who one day just had to go\\n \\n And your gentleness now, which you just can’t help but show\\n \\n Who among them do you think would employ you?\\n \\n Now you stand with your thief, you’re on his parole\\n \\n With your holy medallion which your fingertips fold\\n \\n And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul\\n \\n Oh, who among them do you think could destroy you?\\n \\n Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands\\n \\n Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes\\n \\n My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums\\n \\n Should I leave them by your gate\\n \\n Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?\\n\\nStanding on your window, honey\\n \\n Yes, I’ve been here before\\n \\n Feeling so harmless\\n \\n I’m looking at your second door\\n \\n How come you don’t send me no regards?\\n \\n You know I want your lovin’\\n \\n Honey, why are you so hard?\\n \\n \\n \\n Kneeling ’neath your ceiling\\n \\n Yes, I guess I’ll be here for a while\\n \\n I’m tryin’ to read your portrait, but\\n \\n I’m helpless, like a rich man’s child\\n \\n How come you send someone out to have me barred?\\n \\n You know I want your lovin’\\n \\n Honey, why are you so hard?\\n \\n \\n \\n Like a poor fool in his prime\\n \\n Yes, I know you can hear me walk\\n \\n But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime\\n \\n Or is it just solid rock?\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I rush into your hallway\\n \\n Lean against your velvet door\\n \\n I watch upon your scorpion\\n \\n Who crawls across your circus floor\\n \\n Just what do you think you have to guard?\\n \\n You know I want your lovin’\\n \\n Honey, but you’re so hard\\n \\n \\n \\n Achilles is in your alleyway\\n \\n He don’t want me here, he does brag\\n \\n He’s pointing to the sky\\n \\n And he’s hungry, like a man in drag\\n \\n How come you get someone like him to be your guard?\\n \\n You know I want your lovin’\\n \\n Honey, but you’re so hard\\n\\nNobody feels any pain\\n \\n Tonight as I stand inside the rain\\n \\n Ev’rybody knows\\n \\n That Baby’s got new clothes\\n \\n But lately I see her ribbons and her bows\\n \\n Have fallen from her curls\\n \\n She takes just like a woman, yes, she does\\n \\n She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does\\n \\n And she aches just like a woman\\n \\n But she breaks just like a little girl\\n \\n \\n \\n Queen Mary, she’s my friend\\n \\n Yes, I believe I’ll go see her again\\n \\n Nobody has to guess\\n \\n That Baby can’t be blessed\\n \\n Till she sees finally that she’s like all the rest\\n \\n With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls\\n \\n She takes just like a woman, yes, she does\\n \\n She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does\\n \\n And she aches just like a woman\\n \\n But she breaks just like a little girl\\n \\n \\n \\n It was raining from the first\\n \\n And I was dying there of thirst\\n \\n So I came in here\\n \\n And your long-time curse hurts\\n \\n But what’s worse\\n \\n Is this pain in

Then you ache just like a woman\\n \\n But you break just like a little girl\\n\\nYou say you love me\\n \\n And you’re thinkin’ of me\\n \\n But you know you could be wrong\\n \\n You say you told

sometime\\n \\n We’ll both just sit there and stare\\n \\n Me with my belt\\n \\n Wrapped around my head\\n \\n And you just sittin’ there\\n \\n In your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you\\n \\n It’s bad for your health, he said\\n \\n Yes, I disobeyed his orders\\n \\n I came to see you\\n \\n But I found him there instead\\n \\n You

They’ll stone ya when you’re tryin’ to go home\\n \\n Then they’ll stone ya when you’re there all alone\\n \\n But I would not feel so all alone\\n \\n Everybody must get stoned\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, they’ll stone ya when you’re walkin’ ’long the street\\n \\n They’ll stone ya when you’re tryin’ to keep your seat\\n \\n They’ll stone ya when you’re walkin’ on the floor\\n \\n They’ll stone ya when you’re walkin’ to the door\\n \\n But I would not feel so all alone\\n \\n Everybody must get stoned\\n \\n \\n \\n They’ll stone ya when you’re at the breakfast table\\n \\n They’ll stone ya when you are young and able\\n \\n They’ll stone ya when you’re tryin’ to make a buck\\n \\n They’ll stone ya and then they’ll say, “good luck”\\n \\n Tell ya what, I would not feel so all alone\\n \\n Everybody must get stoned\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, they’ll stone you and say that it’s the end\\n \\n Then they’ll stone you and then they’ll come back again\\n \\n They’ll stone you when you’re riding in

feel so all alone\\n \\n Everybody must get stoned\\n\\nOh, the ragman draws circles\\n \\n Up and down the block\\n \\n I’d ask him what the matter was\\n \\n But I know that he don’t talk\\n \\n And the ladies treat me kindly\\n \\n And furnish me with tape\\n \\n But deep inside my heart\\n \\n I know I can’t escape\\n \\n Oh, Mama, can this really be the end\\n \\n To be stuck inside of Mobile\\n \\n With the Memphis blues again\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, Shakespeare, he’s in the alley\\n \\n With his pointed shoes and his bells\\n \\n Speaking to some French girl\\n \\n Who says she knows me well\\n \\n And I would send a message\\n \\n To find out if she’s talked\\n \\n But the post office has been stolen\\n \\n And the mailbox is locked\\n \\n Oh, Mama, can this really be the end\\n \\n To be stuck inside of Mobile\\n \\n With the Memphis blues again\\n \\n \\n \\n Mona tried to tell me\\n \\n To stay away from the train line\\n \\n She said that all the railroad men\\n \\n Just drink up your blood like wine\\n \\n An’ I said, “Oh, I didn’t know that\\n \\n But then again, there’s only one I’ve met\\n \\n An’ he just smoked my eyelids\\n \\n An’ punched my cigarette”\\n \\n Oh, Mama, can this really be the end\\n \\n To be stuck inside of Mobile\\n \\n With the Memphis blues again\\n \\n \\n \\n Grandpa died last week\\n \\n And now he’s buried in the rocks\\n \\n But everybody still talks about\\n \\n How badly they were shocked\\n \\n But me, I expected it to happen\\n \\n I knew he’d lost control\\n \\n When he built a fire on Main Street\\n \\n And shot it full of holes\\n \\n Oh, Mama, can this really be the end\\n \\n To be stuck inside of Mobile\\n \\n With the Memphis blues again\\n \\n \\n \\n Now the senator came down here\\n \\n Showing ev’ryone his gun\\n \\n Handing out free tickets\\n \\n To the wedding of his son\\n \\n An’ me, I nearly got busted\\n \\n An’ wouldn’t it be my luck\\n \\n To get caught without a ticket\\n \\n And be discovered beneath a truck\\n \\n Oh, Mama, can this really be the end\\n \\n To be stuck inside of Mobile\\n \\n With the Memphis blues again\\n \\n \\n \\n Now the preacher looked so baffled\\n \\n When I asked him why he dressed\\n \\n With twenty pounds of headlines\\n \\n Stapled to his chest\\n \\n But he cursed me when I proved it to him\\n \\n Then I whispered, “Not even you can hide\\n \\n You see, you’re just like me\\n \\n I hope you’re satisfied”\\n \\n Oh, Mama, can this really be the end\\n \\n To be stuck inside of Mobile\\n \\n With the Memphis blues again\\n \\n \\n \\n Now the rainman gave me two cures\\n \\n Then he said, “Jump right in”\\n \\n The one was Texas medicine\\n \\n The other was just railroad gin\\n \\n An’ like a fool I mixed them\\n \\n An’ it strangled up my mind\\n \\n An’ now people just get uglier\\n \\n An’ I have no sense of time\\n \\n Oh, Mama, can this really be the end\\n \\n To be stuck inside of Mobile\\n \\n With the Memphis blues again\\n \\n \\n \\n When Ruthie says come see her\\n \\n In her honky-tonk lagoon\\n \\n Where I can watch her waltz for free\\n \\n ’Neath her Panamanian moon\\n \\n An’ I say, “Aw come on now\\n \\n You must know about my debutante”\\n \\n An’ she says, “Your debutante just knows what you need\\n \\n But I know what you want”\\n \\n Oh, Mama, can this really be the end\\n \\n To be stuck inside of Mobile\\n \\n With the Memphis blues again\\n \\n \\n \\n Now the bricks lay on Grand Street\\n \\n Where the neon madmen climb\\n \\n They all fall there so perfectly\\n \\n It all seems so well timed\\n \\n An’ here I sit so patiently\\n \\n Waiting to find out what price\\n \\n You have to pay to get out of\\n \\n Going through all these things twice\\n \\n Oh, Mama, can this really be the end\\n \\n To be stuck inside of Mobile\\n \\n With the Memphis blues again\\n\\nAin’t it just like the night to play tricks when you’re tryin\\' to be so quiet?\\n \\n We sit here stranded, though we’re all doin’ our best to deny it\\n \\n And Louise holds a handful of rain, temptin’ you to defy it\\n \\n Lights flicker from the opposite loft\\n \\n In this room the heat pipes just cough\\n \\n The country music station plays soft\\n \\n But there’s nothing, really nothing to turn off\\n \\n Just Louise and her lover so entwined\\n \\n And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind\\n \\n \\n \\n In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman’s bluff with the key chain\\n \\n And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the “D” train\\n \\n We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight\\n \\n Ask himself if it’s him or them that’s really insane\\n \\n Louise, she’s all right, she’s just near\\n \\n She’s delicate and seems like the mirror\\n \\n But she just makes it all too concise and too clear\\n \\n That Johanna’s not here\\n \\n The ghost of ’lectricity howls in the bones of her face\\n \\n Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place\\n \\n \\n \\n Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously\\n \\n He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously\\n \\n And when bringing her name up\\n \\n He speaks of a farewell kiss to me\\n \\n He’s sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all\\n \\n Muttering small talk at the wall while I’m in the hall\\n \\n How can I explain?\\n \\n Oh, it’s so hard to get on\\n \\n And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn\\n \\n \\n \\n Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial\\n \\n Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while\\n \\n But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues\\n \\n You can tell by the way she smiles\\n \\n See the primitive wallflower freeze\\n \\n When the jelly-faced women all sneeze\\n \\n Hear the one with the mustache say, “Jeeze\\n \\n I can’t find my knees”\\n \\n Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule\\n \\n But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel\\n \\n \\n \\n The peddler now speaks to the countess who’s pretending to care for him\\n \\n Sayin’, “Name me someone that’s not a parasite and I’ll go out and say a prayer for him”\\n \\n But like Louise always says\\n \\n “Ya can’t look at much, can ya man?”\\n \\n As she, herself, prepares for him\\n \\n And Madonna, she still has not showed\\n \\n We see this empty cage now corrode\\n \\n Where her cape of the stage once had flowed\\n \\n The fiddler, he now steps to the road\\n \\n He writes ev’rything’s been returned which was owed\\n \\n On the back of the fish truck that loads\\n \\n While my conscience explodes\\n \\n The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain\\n \\n And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain\\n\\nYou will search, babe\\n\\nAt any cost\\n\\nBut how long, babe\\n\\nCan you search for what’s not lost?\\n\\nEverybody will help you\\n\\nSome people are very kind\\n\\nBut if I can save you any time\\n\\nCome on, give it to me\\n\\nI’ll keep it with mine\\n\\n\\n\\nI can’t help it\\n\\nIf you might think I’m odd\\n\\nIf I say I’m not loving you for what you are\\n\\nBut for what you’re not\\n\\nEverybody will help you\\n\\nDiscover what you set out to find\\n\\nBut if I can save you any time\\n\\nCome on, give it to me\\n\\nI’ll keep it with mine\\n\\n\\n\\nThe train leaves\\n\\nAt half past ten\\n\\nBut it’ll be back tomorrow\\n\\nSame time again\\n\\nThe conductor he’s weary\\n\\nHe’s still stuck on the line\\n\\nBut if I can save you any time\\n\\nCome on, give it to me\\n\\nI’ll keep it with mine\\n\\nI am a lonesome hobo\\n \\n Without family or friends\\n \\n Where another man’s life might begin\\n \\n That’s exactly where mine ends\\n \\n I have tried my hand at bribery\\n \\n Blackmail and deceit\\n \\n And I’ve served time for ev’rything\\n \\n ’Cept beggin’ on the street\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, once I was rather prosperous\\n \\n There was nothing I did lack\\n \\n I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth\\n \\n And silk upon my back\\n \\n But I did not trust my brother\\n \\n I carried him to blame\\n \\n Which led me to my fatal doom\\n \\n To wander off in shame\\n \\n \\n \\n Kind ladies and kind gentlemen\\n \\n Soon I will be gone\\n \\n But let me just warn you all\\n \\n Before I do pass on\\n \\n Stay free from petty jealousies\\n \\n Live by no man’s code\\n \\n And hold your judgment for yourself\\n \\n Lest you wind up on this road\\n\\nYou got a lotta nerve\\n \\n To say you are my friend\\n \\n When I was down\\n \\n You just stood there grinning\\n \\n \\n \\n You got a lotta nerve\\n \\n To say you got a helping hand to lend\\n \\n You just want to be on\\n \\n The side that’s winning\\n \\n \\n \\n You say I let you down\\n \\n You know it’s not like that\\n \\n If you’re so hurt\\n \\n Why then don’t you show it\\n \\n \\n \\n You say you lost your faith\\n \\n But that’s not where it’s at\\n \\n You had no faith to lose\\n \\n And you know it\\n \\n \\n \\n I know the reason\\n \\n That you talk behind my back\\n \\n I used to be among the crowd\\n \\n You’re in with\\n \\n \\n \\n Do you take me for such a fool\\n \\n To think I’d make contact\\n \\n With the one who tries to hide\\n \\n What he don’t know to begin with\\n \\n \\n \\n You see me on the street\\n \\n You always act surprised\\n \\n You say, “How are you?” “Good luck”\\n \\n But you don’t mean it\\n \\n \\n \\n When you know as well as me\\n \\n You’d rather see me paralyzed\\n \\n Why don’t you just come out once\\n \\n And scream it\\n \\n \\n \\n No, I do not feel that good\\n \\n When I see the heartbreaks you embrace\\n \\n If I was a master thief\\n \\n Perhaps I’d rob them\\n \\n \\n \\n And now I know you’re dissatisfied\\n \\n With your position and your place\\n \\n Don’t you understand\\n \\n It’s not my problem\\n \\n \\n \\n I wish that for just one time\\n \\n You could stand inside my shoes\\n \\n And just for that one moment\\n \\n I could be you\\n \\n \\n \\n Yes, I wish that for just one time\\n \\n You could stand inside my shoes\\n \\n You’d know what a drag it is\\n \\n To see you\\n\\n“Oh, help me in my weakness”\\n \\n I heard the drifter say\\n \\n As they carried him from the courtroom\\n \\n And were taking him away\\n \\n “My trip hasn’t been a pleasant one\\n \\n And my time it isn’t long\\n \\n And I still do not know\\n \\n What it was that I’ve done wrong”\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside\\n \\n A tear came to his eye\\n \\n “You fail to understand,” he said\\n \\n “Why must you even try?”\\n \\n Outside, the crowd was stirring\\n \\n You could hear it from the door\\n \\n Inside, the judge was stepping down\\n \\n While the jury cried for more\\n \\n \\n \\n “Oh, stop that cursed jury”\\n \\n Cried the attendant and the nurse\\n \\n “The trial was bad enough\\n \\n But this is ten times worse”\\n \\n Just then a bolt of lightning\\n \\n Struck the courthouse out of shape\\n \\n And while ev’rybody knelt to pray\\n \\n The drifter did escape\\n\\nDear landlord\\n \\n Please don’t put a price on my soul\\n \\n My burden is heavy\\n \\n My dreams are beyond control\\n \\n When that steamboat whistle blows\\n \\n I’m gonna give you all I got to give\\n \\n And I do hope you receive it well\\n \\n Dependin’ on the way you feel that you live\\n \\n \\n \\n Dear landlord\\n \\n Please heed these words that I speak\\n \\n I know you’ve suffered much\\n \\n But in this you are not so unique\\n \\n All of us, at times, we might work too hard\\n \\n To have it too fast and too much\\n \\n And anyone can fill his life up\\n \\n With things he can see but he just cannot touch\\n \\n \\n \\n Dear landlord\\n \\n Please don’t dismiss my case\\n \\n I’m not about to argue\\n \\n I’m not about to move to no other place\\n \\n Now, each of us has his own special gift\\n \\n And you know this was meant to be true\\n \\n And if you don’t underestimate me\\n \\n I won’t underestimate you\\n\\n“There must be some way out of here,” said the joker to the thief\\n \\n “There’s too much confusion, I can’t get no relief\\n \\n Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth\\n \\n None of them along the line know what any of it is worth”\\n \\n \\n \\n “No reason to get excited,” the thief, he kindly spoke\\n \\n “There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke\\n \\n But you and I, we’ve been through that, and this is not our fate\\n \\n So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late”\\n \\n \\n \\n All along the watchtower, princes kept the view\\n \\n While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too\\n \\n \\n \\n Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl\\n \\n Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl\\n\\nAs I went out one morning\\n \\n To breathe the air around Tom Paine’s\\n \\n I spied the fairest damsel\\n \\n That ever did walk in chains\\n \\n I offer’d her my hand\\n \\n She took me by the arm\\n \\n I knew that very instant\\n \\n She meant to do me harm\\n \\n \\n \\n “Depart from me this moment”\\n \\n I told her with my voice\\n \\n Said she, “But I don’t wish to”\\n \\n Said I, “But you have no choice”\\n \\n “I beg you, sir,” she pleaded\\n \\n From the corners of her mouth\\n \\n “I will secretly accept you\\n \\n And together we’ll fly south”\\n \\n \\n \\n Just then Tom Paine, himself\\n \\n Came running from across the field\\n \\n Shouting at this lovely girl\\n \\n And commanding her to yield\\n \\n And as she was letting go her grip\\n \\n Up Tom Paine did run,\\n \\n “I’m sorry, sir,” he said to me\\n \\n “I’m sorry for what she’s done”\\n\\nJohn Wesley Harding\\n \\n Was a friend to the poor\\n \\n He trav’led with a gun in ev’ry hand\\n \\n All along this countryside\\n \\n

took a stand\\n \\n And soon the situation there\\n \\n Was all but straightened out\\n \\n For he was always known\\n \\n To lend a helping hand\\n \\n \\n \\n All across the telegraph\\n \\n His name it did resound\\n \\n But no charge held against him\\n \\n Could they prove\\n \\n And there was no man around\\n \\n Who could track or chain him down\\n \\n He was never known\\n \\n To make a foolish move\\n\\nThere was a wicked messenger\\n \\n From Eli he did come\\n \\n With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter\\n \\n When questioned who had sent for him\\n \\n He answered with his thumb\\n \\n For his tongue it could not speak, but only flatter\\n \\n \\n \\n He stayed behind the assembly hall\\n \\n It was there he made his bed\\n \\n Oftentimes he could be seen returning\\n \\n Until one day he just appeared\\n \\n With a note in his hand which read\\n \\n “The soles of my feet, I swear they’re burning”\\n \\n \\n \\n Oh, the leaves began to fallin’\\n \\n

of solid gold\\n \\n Searching for the very souls\\n \\n Whom already have been sold\\n \\n \\n \\n “Arise, arise,” he cried so loud\\n \\n In a voice without restraint\\n \\n “Come out, ye gifted

terrified\\n \\n I put my fingers against the glass\\n \\n And bowed my head and cried\\n\\nWell, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest\\n \\n They were the best of friends\\n \\n So when Frankie Lee needed money one day\\n \\n Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens\\n \\n And placed them on a footstool\\n \\n Just above the plotted plain\\n \\n Sayin’, “Take your pick, Frankie Boy\\n \\n My loss will be your gain”\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down\\n \\n And put his fingers to his chin\\n \\n But with the cold eyes of Judas on him\\n \\n His head began to spin\\n \\n “Would ya please not stare at me like that,” he said\\n \\n “It’s just my foolish pride\\n \\n But sometimes a man must be alone\\n \\n And this is no place to hide”\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, Judas, he just winked and said\\n \\n “All right, I’ll leave you here\\n \\n But you’d better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want\\n \\n Before they all disappear”\\n \\n “I’m gonna start my pickin’ right now\\n \\n Just tell me where you’ll be”\\n \\n Judas pointed down the road\\n \\n And said, “Eternity!”\\n \\n \\n \\n “Eternity?” said Frankie Lee\\n \\n With a voice as cold as ice\\n \\n “That’s right,” said Judas Priest, “Eternity\\n \\n Though you might call it ‘Paradise’”\\n \\n “I don’t call it anything”\\n \\n Said Frankie Lee with a smile\\n \\n “All right,” said Judas Priest\\n \\n “I’ll see you after a while”\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down\\n \\n Feelin’ low and mean\\n \\n When just then a passing stranger\\n \\n Burst upon the scene\\n \\n Saying, “Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler\\n \\n Whose father is deceased?\\n \\n Well, if you are, there’s a fellow callin’ you down the road\\n \\n And they say his name is Priest”\\n \\n \\n \\n “Oh, yes, he is my friend”\\n \\n Said Frankie Lee in fright\\n \\n “I do recall him very well\\n \\n In fact, he just left my sight”\\n \\n “Yes, that’s the one,” said the stranger\\n \\n As quiet as a mouse\\n \\n “Well, my message is, he’s down the road\\n \\n Stranded in a house”\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked\\n \\n He dropped ev’rything and ran\\n \\n Until he came up to the spot\\n \\n Where Judas Priest did stand\\n \\n “What kind of house is this,” he said\\n \\n “Where I have come to roam?”\\n \\n “It’s not a house,” said Judas Priest\\n \\n “It’s not a house . . . it’s a home”\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled\\n \\n He soon lost all control\\n \\n Over ev’rything which he had made\\n \\n While the mission bells did toll\\n \\n He just stood there staring\\n \\n At that big house as bright as any sun\\n \\n With four and twenty windows\\n \\n And a woman’s face in ev’ry one\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee\\n \\n With a soulful, bounding leap\\n \\n And, foaming at the mouth\\n \\n He began to make his midnight creep\\n \\n For sixteen nights and days he raved\\n \\n But on the seventeenth he burst\\n \\n Into the arms of Judas Priest\\n \\n Which is where he died of thirst\\n \\n \\n \\n No one tried to say a thing\\n \\n When they took him out in jest\\n \\n Except, of course, the little neighbor boy\\n \\n Who carried him to rest\\n \\n And he just walked along, alone\\n \\n With his guilt so well concealed\\n \\n And muttered underneath his breath\\n \\n “Nothing is revealed”\\n \\n \\n \\n Well, the moral of the story\\n \\n The moral of this song\\n \\n Is simply that one should never be\\n \\n Where one does not belong\\n \\n So when you see your neighbor carryin’ somethin’\\n \\n Help him with his load\\n \\n And don’t go mistaking Paradise\\n \\n For that home across the road\\n\\nI pity the poor immigrant\\n \\n Who wishes he would’ve stayed home\\n \\n Who uses all his power to do evil\\n \\n But in the end is always left so alone\\n \\n That man whom with his fingers cheats\\n \\n And who lies with ev’ry breath\\n \\n Who passionately hates his life\\n \\n And likewise, fears his death\\n \\n \\n \\n I pity the poor immigrant\\n \\n Whose strength is spent in vain\\n \\n Whose heaven is like Ironsides\\n \\n Whose tears are like rain\\n \\n Who eats but is not satisfied\\n \\n Who hears but does not see\\n \\n Who falls in love with wealth itself\\n \\n And turns his back on me\\n \\n \\n \\n I pity the poor immigrant\\n \\n Who tramples through the mud\\n \\n Who fills his mouth with laughing\\n \\n And who builds his town with blood\\n \\n Whose visions in the final end\\n \\n Must shatter like the glass\\n \\n I pity the poor immigrant\\n \\n When his gladness comes to pass\\n\\nI have heard rumors all over town\\n \\n They say that you’re planning to put me down\\n \\n All I would like you to do\\n \\n Is tell me that it isn’t true\\n \\n \\n \\n They say that you’ve been seen with some other man\\n \\n That he’s tall, dark and handsome, and you’re holding his hand\\n \\n Darlin’, I’m a-countin’ on you\\n \\n Tell me that it isn’t true\\n \\n \\n \\n To know that some other man is holdin’ you tight\\n \\n It hurts me all over, it doesn’t seem right\\n \\n \\n \\n All of those awful things that I have heard\\n \\n I don’t want to believe them, all I want is your word\\n \\n So darlin’, you better come through\\n \\n Tell me that it isn’t true\\n \\n \\n \\n All of those awful things that I have heard\\n \\n I don’t want to believe them, all I

things\\n\\nI could say that I’d be faithful, I could say it in one sweet, easy breath\\n\\nBut to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death\\n\\n\\n\\nSomething there is about you

been complete\\n\\nI’ve said goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street\\n\\nTo the courtyard of the jester which is hidden from the sun\\n\\nI love you more than ever and I haven’t yet begun\\n\\n\\n\\nYou breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live\\n\\nWhen I was deep in poverty you taught me how to give\\n\\nDried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole\\n\\nQuenched my thirst and satisfied the burning in my soul\\n\\n\\n\\nYou gave me babies one, two, three, what is more, you saved my life\\n\\nEye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife\\n\\nMy thoughts of you don’t ever rest, they’d kill me if I lie\\n\\nI’d sacrifice the world for you and watch my senses die\\n\\n\\n\\nThe tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth\\n\\nWe’ll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth\\n\\nWhat’s lost is lost, we can’t regain what went down in the flood\\n\\nBut happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s never been my duty to remake the world at large\\n\\nNor is it my intention to sound a battle charge\\n\\n’Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn’t bend\\n\\nAnd if there is eternity I’d love you there again\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, can’t you see that you were born to stand by my side\\n\\nAnd I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride\\n\\nYou’re the other half of what I am, you’re the missing piece\\n\\nAnd I love you more than ever with that love that doesn’t cease\\n\\n\\n\\nYou turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see\\n\\nJust bein’ next to you is a natural thing for me\\n\\nAnd I could never let you go, no matter what goes on\\n\\n‘Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone\\n\\nI’ve just reached a place\\n\\nWhere the willow don’t bend\\n\\nThere’s not much more to be said\\n\\nIt’s the top of the end\\n\\nI’m going\\n\\nI’m going\\n\\nI’m gone\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m closin’ the

grounds\\n\\nWe got much to talk about\\n\\nAnd much to reminisce\\n\\nIt sure is right\\n\\nOn a night like this\\n\\n\\n\\nOn a night like this\\n\\nSo glad you’ve come to stay\\n\\nHold on to me, pretty miss\\n\\nSay you’ll never go away to stray\\n\\nRun your fingers down my spine\\n\\nBring me a touch of bliss\\n\\nIt sure feels right\\n\\nOn a night like this\\n\\n\\n\\nOn a night like this\\n\\nI can’t get any sleep\\n\\nThe air is so cold outside\\n\\nAnd the snow’s so deep\\n\\nBuild a fire, throw on logs\\n\\nAnd listen to it hiss\\n\\nAnd let it burn, burn, burn, burn\\n\\nOn a night like this\\n\\n\\n\\nPut your body next to mine\\n\\nAnd keep me company\\n\\nThere is plenty a-room for all\\n\\nSo please don’t elbow me\\n\\n\\n\\nLet the four winds blow\\n\\nAround this old cabin door\\n\\nIf I’m not too far off\\n\\nI think we did this once before\\n\\nThere’s more frost on the window glass\\n\\nWith each new tender kiss\\n\\nBut it sure feels right\\n\\nOn a night like this\\n\\nTwilight on the frozen lake\\n\\nNorth wind about to break\\n\\nOn footprints in the snow\\n\\nSilence down below\\n\\n\\n\\nYou’re beautiful beyond words\\n\\nYou’re beautiful to me\\n\\nYou can make me cry\\n\\nNever say goodbye\\n\\n\\n\\nTime is all I have to give\\n\\nYou can have it if you choose\\n\\nWith me you can live\\n\\nNever say goodbye\\n\\n\\n\\nMy dreams are made of iron and steel\\n\\nWith a big bouquet\\n\\nOf roses hanging down\\n\\nFrom the heavens to the ground\\n\\n\\n\\nThe crashing waves roll over me\\n\\nAs I stand upon the sand\\n\\nWait for you to come\\n\\nAnd grab hold of my hand\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, baby, baby, baby blue\\n\\nYou’ll change your last name, too\\n\\nYou’ve turned your hair to brown\\n\\nLove to see it hangin’ down\\n\\nYou angel you\\n\\nYou got me under your wing\\n\\nThe way you walk and the way you talk\\n\\nI feel I could almost sing\\n\\n\\n\\nYou angel you\\n\\nYou’re as fine as anything’s fine\\n\\nThe way you walk and the way you talk\\n\\nIt sure plays on my mind\\n\\n\\n\\nYou know I can’t sleep at night for trying\\n\\nNever did feel this way before\\n\\nI get up at night and walk the floor\\n\\nIf this is love then gimme more\\n\\nAnd more and more and more and more\\n\\n\\n\\nYou angel you\\n\\nYou’re as fine as can be\\n\\nThe way you smile like a sweet baby child\\n\\nIt just falls all over me\\n\\n\\n\\nYou know I can’t sleep at night for trying\\n\\nNever did feel this way before\\n\\nNever did get up and walk the floor\\n\\nIf this is love then gimme more\\n\\nAnd more and more and more\\n\\n\\n\\nYou angel you\\n\\nYou got me under your wing\\n\\nThe way you walk and the way you talk\\n\\nIt says everything\\n\\nThey sat together in the park\\n\\nAs the evening sky grew dark\\n\\nShe looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones\\n\\n’Twas then he felt alone and wished that he’d gone straight\\n\\nAnd watched out for a simple twist of fate\\n\\n\\n\\nThey walked along by the old canal\\n\\nA little confused, I remember well\\n\\nAnd stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burnin’ bright\\n\\nHe felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train\\n\\nMoving with a simple twist of fate\\n\\n\\n\\nA saxophone someplace far off played\\n\\nAs she was walkin’ by the arcade\\n\\nAs the light bust through a beat-up shade where he was wakin’ up,\\n\\nShe dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate\\n\\nAnd forgot about a simple twist of fate\\n\\n\\n\\nHe woke up, the room was bare\\n\\nHe didn’t see her anywhere\\n\\nHe told himself he didn’t care, pushed the window open wide\\n\\nFelt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate\\n\\nBrought on by a simple twist of fate\\n\\n\\n\\nHe hears the ticking of the clocks\\n\\nAnd walks along with a parrot that talks\\n\\nHunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in\\n\\nMaybe she’ll pick him out again, how long must he wait\\n\\nOnce more for a simple twist of fate\\n\\n\\n\\nPeople tell me it’s a sin\\n\\nTo know and feel too much within\\n\\nI still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring\\n\\nShe was born in spring, but I was born too late\\n\\nBlame it on a simple twist of fate\\n\\nI can see the turning of the key\\nI\\'ve been deceived by the clown inside of me\\nI thought that he was righteous but he\\'s vain\\nOh, something\\'s a-telling me I wear the ball and chain\\nMy patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost\\nHe\\'s always off somewhere when I need him most\\nThe Spanish moon is rising on the hill\\nBut my heart is a-tellin\\' me I love you still\\nI come back to the town from the flaming moon\\nI see you in the streets, I begin to swoon\\nI love to see you dress before the mirror\\nWon\\'t you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?\\nEverybody\\'s wearing a disguise\\nTo hide what they\\'ve got left behind their eyes\\nBut me, I can\\'t cover what I am\\nWherever the children go I\\'ll follow them\\nI march in the parade of liberty\\nBut as long as I love you I\\'m not free\\nHow long must I suffer such abuse?\\nWon\\'t you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?\\nI\\'ve given up the game, I\\'ve got to leave\\nThe pot of gold is only make-believe\\nThe treasure can\\'t be found by men who search\\nWhose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church\\nWe sat in an empty theater and we kissed\\nI asked ya please to cross me off your list\\nMy head tells me it\\'s time to make a change\\nBut my heart is telling me I love ya but you\\'re strange\\nSo one more time at midnight, near the wall\\nTake off your heavy make-up and your shawl\\nWon\\'t you descend from the throne, from where you sit?\\nLet me feel your love one more time before I abandon it\\n\\nEverything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing\\n\\nDeath kept followin’, trackin’ us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing\\n\\nNow somebody’s got to show their hand, time is an enemy\\n\\nI know you’re long gone, I guess it must be up to me\\n\\n\\n\\nIf I’d thought about it I never would’ve done it, I guess I would’ve let it slide\\n\\nIf I’d lived my life by what others were thinkin’, the heart inside me would’ve died\\n\\nI was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity\\n\\nSomeone had to reach for the risin’ star, I guess it was up to me\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, the Union Central is pullin’ out and the orchids are in bloom\\n\\nI’ve only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume\\n\\nIn fourteen months I’ve only smiled once and I didn’t do it consciously\\n\\nSomebody’s got to find your trail, I guess it must be up to me\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch\\n\\nI’d just about convinced myself that nothin’ had changed that much\\n\\nThe old Rounder in the iron mask slipped me the master key\\n\\nSomebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers’ club\\n\\nI would’ve followed you in the door but I didn’t have a ticket stub\\n\\nSo I waited all night ’til the break of day, hopin’ one of us could get free\\n\\nWhen the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, the only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk\\n\\nWas to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work\\n\\nWas I a fool or not to try to protect your identity?\\n\\nYou looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I met somebody face to face and I had to remove my hat\\n\\nShe’s everything I need and love but I can’t be swayed by that\\n\\nIt frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be\\n\\nBut she ain’t a-gonna make me move, I guess it must be up to me\\n\\n\\n\\nWe heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex\\n\\nIt didn’t amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects\\n\\nWhen you bite off more than you can chew you pay the penalty\\n\\nSomebody’s got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, Dupree came in pimpin’ tonight to the Thunderbird Café\\n\\nCrystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way\\n\\nWell, I just can’t rest without you, love, I need your company\\n\\nBut you ain’t a-gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle\\n\\nShe’s the one you been wond’rin’ about, but there’s really nothin’ much to tell\\n\\nWe both heard voices for a while, now the rest is history\\n\\nSomebody’s got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me\\n\\n\\n\\nSo go on, boys, and play your hands, life is a pantomime\\n\\nThe ringleaders from the county seat say you don’t have all that much time\\n\\nAnd the girl with me behind the shades, she ain’t my property\\n\\nOne of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd if we never meet again, baby, remember me\\n\\nHow my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody\\n\\nAnd the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you, free\\n\\nNo one else could play that tune, you know it was up to m\\n\\nOur conversation was short and sweet\\n\\nIt nearly swept me off-a my feet\\n\\nAnd I’m back in the rain, oh, oh\\n\\nAnd you are on dry land\\n\\nYou made it there somehow\\n\\nYou’re a big girl now\\n\\n\\n\\nBird on the horizon, sittin’ on a fence\\n\\nHe’s singin’ his song for me at his own expense\\n\\nAnd I’m just like that bird, oh, oh\\n\\nSingin’ just for you\\n\\nI hope that you can hear\\n\\nHear me singin’ through these tears\\n\\n\\n\\nTime is a jet plane, it moves too fast\\n\\nOh, but what a shame if all we’ve shared can’t last\\n\\nI can change, I swear, oh, oh\\n\\nSee what you can do\\n\\nI can make it through\\n\\nYou can make it too\\n\\n\\n\\nLove is so simple, to quote a phrase\\n\\nYou’ve known it all the time, I’m learnin’ it these days\\n\\nOh, I know where I can find you, oh, oh\\n\\nIn somebody’s room\\n\\nIt’s a price I have to pay\\n\\nYou’re a big girl all the way\\n\\n\\n\\nA change in the weather is known to be extreme\\n\\nBut what’s the sense of changing horses in midstream?\\n\\nI’m going out of my mind, oh, oh\\n\\nWith a pain that stops and starts\\n\\nLike a corkscrew to my heart\\n\\nEver since we’ve been apart\\n\\nLazy stadium night\\n\\nCatfish on the mound\\n\\n“Strike three,” the umpire said\\n\\nBatter have to go back and sit down\\n\\n\\n\\nCatfish, million-dollar-man\\n\\nNobody can throw the ball like Catfish can\\n\\n\\n\\nUsed to work on Mr. Finley’s farm\\n\\nBut the old man wouldn’t pay\\n\\nSo he packed his glove and took his arm\\n\\nAn’ one day he just ran away\\n\\n\\n\\nCatfish, million-dollar-man\\n\\nNobody can throw the ball like Catfish can\\n\\n\\n\\nCome up where the Yankees are\\n\\nDress up in a pinstripe suit\\n\\nSmoke a custom-made cigar\\n\\nWear an alligator boot\\n\\n\\n\\nCatfish, million-dollar-man\\n\\nNobody can throw the ball like Catfish can\\n\\n\\n\\nCarolina born and bred\\n\\nLove to hunt the little quail\\n\\nGot a hundred-acre spread\\n\\nGot some huntin’ dogs for sale\\n\\n\\n\\nCatfish, million-dollar-man\\n\\nNobody can throw the ball like Catfish can\\n\\n\\n\\nReggie Jackson at the plate\\n\\nSeein’ nothin’ but the curve\\n\\nSwing too early or too late\\n\\nGot to eat what Catfish serve\\n\\n\\n\\nCatfish, million-dollar-man\\n\\nNobody can throw the ball like Catfish can\\n\\n\\n\\nEven Billy Martin grins\\n\\nWhen the Fish is in the game\\n\\nEvery season twenty wins\\n\\nGonna make the Hall of Fame\\n\\n\\n\\nCatfish, million-dollar-man\\n\\nNobody can throw the ball like Catfish can\\n\\nSmoky autumn night, stars up in the sky\\n\\nI see the sailin’ boats across the bay go by\\n\\nEucalyptus trees hang above the street\\n\\nAnd then I turn my head, for you’re approachin’ me\\n\\nMoonlight on the water, fisherman’s daughter, floatin’ in to my room\\n\\nWith a golden loom\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst we wash our feet near the immortal shrine\\n\\nAnd then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine\\n\\nI see the hungry clouds up above your face\\n\\nAnd then the tears roll down, what a bitter taste\\n\\nAnd then you drift away on a summer’s day where the wildflowers bloom\\n\\nWith your golden loom\\n\\n\\n\\nI walk across the bridge in the dismal light\\n\\nWhere all the cars are stripped between the gates of night\\n\\nI see the trembling lion with the lotus flower tail\\n\\nAnd then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil\\n\\nBut you’re gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume\\n\\nAnd your golden loom\\n\\n\\n’Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood\\n\\nWhen blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud\\n\\nI came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form\\n\\n“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd if I pass this way again, you can rest assured\\n\\nI’ll always do my best for her, on that I give my word\\n\\nIn a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm\\n\\n“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\\n\\n\\n\\nNot a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved\\n\\nEverything up to that point had been left unresolved\\n\\nTry imagining a place where it’s always safe and warm\\n\\n“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\\n\\n\\n\\nI was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail\\n\\nPoisoned in the bushes an’ blown out on the trail\\n\\nHunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn\\n\\n“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\\n\\n\\n\\nSuddenly I turned around and she was standin’ there\\n\\nWith silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair\\n\\nShe walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns\\n\\n“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\\n\\n\\n\\nNow there’s a wall between us, somethin’ there’s been lost\\n\\nI took too much for granted, got my signals crossed\\n\\nJust to think that it all began on a long-forgotten morn\\n\\n“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount\\n\\nBut nothing really matters much, it’s doom alone that counts\\n\\nAnd the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn\\n\\n“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\\n\\n\\n\\nI’ve heard newborn babies wailin’ like a mournin’ dove\\n\\nAnd old men with broken teeth stranded without love\\n\\nDo I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?\\n\\n“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes\\n\\nI bargained for salvation an’ they gave me a lethal dose\\n\\nI offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn\\n\\n“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I’m livin’ in a foreign country but I’m bound to cross the line\\n\\nBeauty walks a razor’s edge, someday I’ll make it mine\\n\\nIf I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born\\n\\n“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\\n\\nThe festival was over, the boys were all plannin’ for a fall\\n\\nThe cabaret was quiet except for the drillin’ in the wall\\n\\nThe curfew had been lifted and the gamblin’ wheel shut down\\n\\nAnyone with any sense had already left town\\n\\nHe was standin’ in the doorway lookin’ like the Jack of Hearts\\n\\n\\n\\nHe moved across the mirrored room, “Set it up for everyone,” he said\\n\\nThen everyone commenced to do what they were doin’ before he turned their heads\\n\\nThen he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin\\n\\n“Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?”\\n\\nThen he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts\\n\\n\\n\\nBackstage the girls were playin’ five-card stud by the stairs\\n\\nLily had two queens, she was hopin’ for a third to match her pair\\n\\nOutside the streets were fillin’ up, the window was open wide\\n\\nA gentle breeze was blowin’, you could feel it from inside\\n\\nLily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts\\n\\n\\n\\nBig Jim was no one’s fool, he owned the town’s only diamond mine\\n\\nHe made his usual entrance lookin’ so dandy and so fine\\n\\nWith his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place\\n\\nHe took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste\\n\\nBut his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts\\n\\n\\n\\nRosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town\\n\\nShe slipped in through the side door lookin’ like a queen without a crown\\n\\nShe fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear\\n\\n“Sorry, darlin’, that I’m late,” but he didn’t seem to hear\\n\\nHe was starin’ into space over at the Jack of Hearts\\n\\n\\n\\n“I know I’ve seen that face before,” Big Jim was thinkin’ to himself\\n\\n“Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody’s shelf”\\n\\nBut then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the houselights did dim\\n\\nAnd in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him\\n\\nStarin’ at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts\\n\\n\\n\\nLily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child\\n\\nShe did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled\\n\\nShe’d come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs\\n\\nWith men in every walk of life which took her everywhere\\n\\nBut she’d never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts\\n\\n\\n\\nThe hangin’ judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined\\n\\nThe drillin’ in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind\\n\\nIt was known all around that Lily had Jim’s ring\\n\\nAnd nothing would ever come between Lily and the king\\n\\nNo, nothin’ ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts\\n\\n\\n\\nRosemary started drinkin’ hard and seein’ her reflection in the knife\\n\\nShe was tired of the attention, tired of playin’ the role of Big Jim’s wife\\n\\nShe had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide\\n\\nWas lookin’ to do just one good deed before she died\\n\\nShe was gazin’ to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts\\n\\n\\n\\nLily washed her face, took her dress off and buried it away\\n\\n“Has your luck run out?” she laughed at him, “Well, I guess you must\\n\\n    have known it would someday\\n\\nBe careful not to touch the wall, there’s a brand-new coat of paint\\n\\nI’m glad to see you’re still alive, you’re lookin’ like a saint”\\n\\nDown the hallway footsteps were comin’ for the Jack of Hearts\\n\\n\\n\\nThe backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair\\n\\n“There’s something funny going on,” he said, “I can just feel it in the air”\\n\\nHe went to get the hangin’ judge, but the hangin’ judge was drunk\\n\\nAs the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk\\n\\nThere was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts\\n\\n\\n\\nLily’s arms were locked around the man that she dearly loved to touch\\n\\nShe forgot all about the man she couldn’t stand who hounded her so much\\n\\n“I’ve missed you so,” she said to him, and he felt she was sincere\\n\\nBut just beyond the door he felt jealousy and fear\\n\\nJust another night in the life of the Jack of Hearts\\n\\n\\n\\nNo one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick\\n\\nThe door to the dressing room burst open and a cold revolver clicked\\n\\nAnd Big Jim was standin’ there, ya couldn’t say surprised\\n\\nRosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes\\n\\nShe was with Big Jim but she was leanin’ to the Jack of Hearts\\n\\n\\n\\nTwo doors down the boys finally made it through the wall\\n\\nAnd cleaned out the bank safe, it’s said that they got off with quite a haul\\n\\nIn the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground\\n\\nFor one more member who had business back in town\\n\\nBut they couldn’t go no further without the Jack of Hearts\\n\\n\\n\\nThe next day was hangin’ day, the sky was overcast and black\\n\\nBig Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back\\n\\nAnd Rosemary on the gallows, she didn’t even blink\\n\\nThe hangin’ judge was sober, he hadn’t had a drink\\n\\nThe only person on the scene missin’ was the Jack of Hearts\\n\\n\\n\\nThe cabaret was empty now, a sign said, “Closed for repair”\\n\\nLily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair\\n\\nShe was thinkin’ ’bout her father, who she very rarely saw\\n\\nThinkin’ ’bout Rosemary and thinkin’ about the law\\n\\nBut most of all she was thinkin’ ’bout the Jack of Hearts\\n\\nBuckets of rain\\n\\nBuckets of tears\\n\\nGot all them buckets comin’ out of my ears\\n\\nBuckets of moonbeams in my hand\\n\\nI got all the love, honey baby\\n\\nYou can stand\\n\\n\\n\\nI been meek\\n\\nAnd hard like an oak\\n\\nI seen pretty people disappear like smoke\\n\\nFriends will arrive, friends will disappear\\n\\nIf you want me, honey baby\\n\\nI’ll be here\\n\\n\\n\\nLike your smile\\n\\nAnd your fingertips\\n\\nLike the way that you move your lips\\n\\nI like the cool way you look at me\\n\\nEverything about you is bringing me\\n\\nMisery\\n\\n\\n\\nLittle red wagon\\n\\nLittle red bike\\n\\nI ain’t no monkey but I know what I like\\n\\nI like the way you love me strong and slow\\n\\nI’m takin’ you with me, honey baby\\n\\nWhen I go\\n\\n\\n\\nLife is sad\\n\\nLife is a bust\\n\\nAll ya can do is do what you must\\n\\nYou do what you must do and ya do it well\\n\\nI’ll do it for you, honey baby\\n\\nCan’t you tell?\\n\\nI plan it all and I take my place\\n\\nYou break your promise all over the place\\n\\nYou promised to love me, but what do I see\\n\\nJust you comin’ and spillin’ juice over me\\n\\nOdds and ends, odds and ends\\n\\nLost time is not found again\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, you take your file and you bend my head\\n\\nI never can remember anything that you said\\n\\nYou promised to love me, but what do I know\\n\\nYou’re always spillin’ juice on me like you got someplace to go\\n\\nOdds and ends, odds and ends\\n\\nLost time is not found again\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, I’ve had enough, my box is clean\\n\\nYou know what I’m sayin’ and you know what I mean\\n\\nFrom now on you’d best get on someone else\\n\\nWhile you’re doin’ it, keep that juice to yourself\\n\\nOdds and ends, odds and ends\\n\\nLost time is not found again\\n\\nI’m going down to Rose Marie’s\\n\\nShe never does me wrong\\n\\nShe puts it to me plain as day\\n\\nAnd gives it to me for a song\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s a wicked life but what the hell\\n\\nThe stars ain’t falling down\\n\\nI’m standing outside the Taj Mahal\\n\\nI don’t see no one around\\n\\n\\n\\nGoin’ to Acapulco–goin’ on the run\\n\\nGoin’ down to see fat gut–goin’ to have some fun\\n\\nYeah–goin’ to have some fun\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, whenever I get up\\n\\nAnd I ain’t got what I see\\n\\nI just make it down to Rose Marie’s\\n\\n’Bout a quarter after three\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are worse ways of getting there\\n\\nAnd I ain’t complainin’ none\\n\\nIf the clouds don’t drop and the train don’t stop\\n\\nI’m bound to meet the sun\\n\\n\\n\\nGoin’ to Acapulco–goin’ on the run\\n\\nGoin’ down to see fat gut–goin’ to have some fun\\n\\nYeah–goin’ to have some fun\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, if someone offers me a joke\\n\\nI just say no thanks\\n\\nI try to tell it like it is\\n\\nAnd keep away from pranks\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, sometime you know when the well breaks down\\n\\nI just go pump on it some\\n\\nRose Marie, she likes to go to big places\\n\\nAnd just set there waitin’ for me to come\\n\\n\\n\\nGoin’ to Acapulco–goin’ on the run\\n\\nGoin’ down to see fat gut–goin’ to have some fun\\n\\nYeah–goin’ to have some fun\\n\\nEarly one mornin’ the sun was shinin’\\n\\nI was layin’ in bed\\n\\nWond’rin’ if she’d changed at all\\n\\nIf her hair was still red\\n\\nHer folks they said our lives together\\n\\nSure was gonna be rough\\n\\nThey never did like Mama’s homemade dress\\n\\nPapa’s bankbook wasn’t big enough\\n\\nAnd I was standin’ on the side of the road\\n\\nRain fallin’ on my shoes\\n\\nHeading out for the East Coast\\n\\nLord knows I’ve paid some dues gettin’ through\\n\\nTangled up in blue\\n\\n\\n\\nShe was married when we first met\\n\\nSoon to be divorced\\n\\nI helped her out of a jam, I guess\\n\\nBut I used a little too much force\\n\\nWe drove that car as far as we could\\n\\nAbandoned it out West\\n\\nSplit up on a dark sad night\\n\\nBoth agreeing it was best\\n\\nShe turned around to look at me\\n\\nAs I was walkin’ away\\n\\nI heard her say over my shoulder\\n\\n“We’ll meet again someday on the avenue”\\n\\nTangled up in blue\\n\\n\\n\\nI had a job in the great north woods\\n\\nWorking as a cook for a spell\\n\\nBut I never did like it all that much\\n\\nAnd one day the ax just fell\\n\\nSo I drifted down to New Orleans\\n\\nWhere I happened to be employed\\n\\nWorkin’ for a while on a fishin’ boat\\n\\nRight outside of Delacroix\\n\\nBut all the while I was alone\\n\\nThe past was close behind\\n\\nI seen a lot of women\\n\\nBut she never escaped my mind, and I just grew\\n\\nTangled up in blue\\n\\n\\n\\nShe was workin’ in a topless place\\n\\nAnd I stopped in for a beer\\n\\nI just kept lookin’ at the side of her face\\n\\nIn the spotlight so clear\\n\\nAnd later on as the crowd thinned out\\n\\nI’s just about to do the same\\n\\nShe was standing there in back of my chair\\n\\nSaid to me, “Don’t I know your name?”\\n\\nI muttered somethin’ underneath my breath\\n\\nShe studied the lines on my face\\n\\nI must admit I felt a little uneasy\\n\\nWhen she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe\\n\\nTangled up in blue\\n\\n\\n\\nShe lit a burner on the stove\\n\\nAnd offered me a pipe\\n\\n“I thought you’d never say hello,” she said\\n\\n“You look like the silent type”\\n\\nThen she opened up a book of poems\\n\\nAnd handed it to me\\n\\nWritten by an Italian poet\\n\\nFrom the thirteenth century\\n\\nAnd every one of them words rang true\\n\\nAnd glowed like burnin’ coal\\n\\nPourin’ off of every page\\n\\nLike it was written in my soul from me to you\\n\\nTangled up in blue\\n\\n\\n\\nI lived with them on Montague Street\\n\\nIn a basement down the stairs\\n\\nThere was music in the cafés at night\\n\\nAnd revolution in the air\\n\\nThen he started into dealing with slaves\\n\\nAnd something inside of him died\\n\\nShe had to sell everything she owned\\n\\nAnd froze up inside\\n\\nAnd when finally the bottom fell out\\n\\nI became withdrawn\\n\\nThe only thing I knew how to do\\n\\nWas to keep on keepin’ on like a bird that flew\\n\\nTangled up in blue\\n\\n\\n\\nSo now I’m goin’ back again\\n\\nI got to get to her somehow\\n\\nAll the people we used to know\\n\\nThey’re an illusion to me now\\n\\nSome are mathematicians\\n\\nSome are carpenters’ wives\\n\\nDon’t know how it all got started\\n\\nI don’t know what they’re doin’ with their lives\\n\\nBut me, I’m still on the road\\n\\nHeadin’ for another joint\\n\\nWe always did feel the same\\n\\nWe just saw it from a different point of view\\n\\nTangled up in blue\\n\\nIf you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier\\n\\nIt’s the city ’cross the water, not too far from here\\n\\nSay for me that I’m all right though things are kind of slow\\n\\nShe might think that I’ve forgotten her. Don’t tell her it isn’t so\\n\\n\\n\\nWe had a falling-out, like lovers sometimes do\\n\\nBut to think of how she left that night, it hurts me through and through\\n\\nAnd though our situation pierced me to the bone\\n\\nI got to find someone to take her place. I don’t like to be alone\\n\\n\\n\\nI see a lot of people as I make the rounds\\n\\nAnd I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town\\n\\nAnd I’ve never gotten used to it, I’ve just learned to turn it off\\n\\nHer eyes were blue, her hair was too, her skin so sweet and soft\\n\\n\\n\\nSundown, yellow moon, I replay the past\\n\\nI know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast\\n\\nIf she’s passin’ back this way, and I sure hope she don’t\\n\\nTell her she can look me up. I’ll either be here or I won’t\\n\\nWell, that big dumb blonde\\n\\nWith her wheel in the gorge\\n\\nAnd Turtle, that friend of theirs\\n\\nWith his checks all forged\\n\\nAnd his cheeks in a chunk\\n\\nWith his cheese in the cash\\n\\nThey’re all gonna be there\\n\\nAt that million dollar bash\\n\\nOoh, baby, ooh-ee\\n\\nOoh, baby, ooh-ee\\n\\nIt’s that million dollar bash\\n\\n\\n\\nEv’rybody from right now\\n\\nTo over there and back\\n\\nThe louder they come\\n\\nThe harder they crack\\n\\nCome now, sweet cream\\n\\nDon’t forget to flash\\n\\nWe’re all gonna meet\\n\\nAt that million dollar bash\\n\\nOoh, baby, ooh-ee\\n\\nOoh, baby, ooh-ee\\n\\nIt’s that million dollar bash\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I took my counselor\\n\\nOut to the barn\\n\\nSilly Nelly was there\\n\\nShe told him a yarn\\n\\nThen along came Jones\\n\\nEmptied the trash\\n\\nEv’rybody went down\\n\\nTo that million dollar bash\\n\\nOoh, baby, ooh-ee\\n\\nOoh, baby, ooh-ee\\n\\nIt’s that million dollar bash\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I’m hittin’ it too hard\\n\\nMy stones won’t take\\n\\nI get up in the mornin’\\n\\nBut it’s too early to wake\\n\\nFirst it’s hello, goodbye\\n\\nThen push and then crash\\n\\nBut we’re all gonna make it\\n\\nAt that million dollar bash\\n\\nOoh, baby, ooh-ee\\n\\nOoh, baby, ooh-ee\\n\\nIt’s that million dollar bash\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I looked at my watch\\n\\nI looked at my wrist\\n\\nPunched myself in the face\\n\\nWith my fist\\n\\nI took my potatoes\\n\\nDown to be mashed\\n\\nThen I made it over\\n\\nTo that million dollar bash\\n\\nOoh, baby, ooh-ee\\n\\nOoh, baby, ooh-ee\\n\\nIt’s that million dollar bash\\n\\nSomeone’s got it in for me, they’re planting stories in the press\\n\\nWhoever it is I wish they’d cut it out but when they will I can only guess\\n\\nThey say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy\\n\\nShe inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me\\n\\nI can’t help it if I’m lucky\\n\\n\\n\\nPeople see me all the time and they just can’t remember how to act\\n\\nTheir minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts\\n\\nEven you, yesterday you had to ask me where it was at\\n\\nI couldn’t believe after all these years, you didn’t know me better than that\\n\\nSweet lady\\n\\n\\n\\nIdiot wind, blowing every time you move your mouth\\n\\nBlowing down the backroads headin’ south\\n\\nIdiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth\\n\\nYou’re an idiot, babe\\n\\nIt’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe\\n\\n\\n\\nI ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike\\n\\nI haven’t known peace and quiet for so long I can’t remember what it’s like\\n\\nThere’s a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pourin’ out of a boxcar door\\n\\nYou didn’t know it, you didn’t think it could be done, in the final end he won the wars\\n\\nAfter losin’ every battle\\n\\n\\n\\nI woke up on the roadside, daydreamin’ ’bout the way things sometimes are\\n\\nVisions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are makin’ me see stars\\n\\nYou hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies\\n\\nOne day you’ll be in the ditch, flies buzzin’ around your eyes\\n\\nBlood on your saddle\\n\\n\\n\\nIdiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb\\n\\nBlowing through the curtains in your room\\n\\nIdiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth\\n\\nYou’re an idiot, babe\\n\\nIt’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart\\n\\nYou tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn’t enough to change my heart\\n\\nNow everything’s a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped\\n\\nWhat’s good is bad, what’s bad is good, you’ll find out when you reach the top\\n\\nYou’re on the bottom\\n\\n\\n\\nI noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blind\\n\\nI can’t remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes\\n\\n    don’t look into mine\\n\\nThe priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the\\n\\n    building burned\\n\\nI waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees, while the\\n\\n    springtime turned\\n\\nSlowly into Autumn\\n\\n\\n\\nIdiot wind, blowing like a circle around my skull\\n\\nFrom the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol\\n\\nIdiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth\\n\\nYou’re an idiot, babe\\n\\nIt’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe\\n\\n\\n\\nI can’t feel you anymore, I can’t even touch the books you’ve read\\n\\nEvery time I crawl past your door, I been wishin’ I was somebody else instead\\n\\nDown the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy\\n\\nI followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory\\n\\nAnd all your ragin’ glory\\n\\n\\n\\nI been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I’m finally free\\n\\nI kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me\\n\\nYou’ll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above\\n\\nAnd I’ll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love\\n\\nAnd it makes me feel so sorry\\n\\n\\n\\nIdiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats\\n\\nBlowing through the letters that we wrote\\n\\nIdiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves\\n\\nWe’re idiots, babe\\n\\nIt’s a wonder we can even feed ourselves\\n\\nI pulled out for San Anton’\\n\\nI never felt so good\\n\\nMy woman said she’d meet me there\\n\\nAnd of course, I knew she would\\n\\nThe coachman, he hit me for my hook\\n\\nAnd he asked me my name\\n\\nI give it to him right away\\n\\nThen I hung my head in shame\\n\\nLo and behold! Lo and behold!\\n\\nLookin’ for my lo and behold\\n\\nGet me outa here, my dear man!\\n\\n\\n\\nI come into Pittsburgh\\n\\nAt six-thirty flat\\n\\nI found myself a vacant seat\\n\\nAn’ I put down my hat\\n\\n“What’s the matter, Molly, dear\\n\\nWhat’s the matter with your mound?”\\n\\n“What’s it to ya, Moby Dick?\\n\\nThis is chicken town!”\\n\\nLo and behold! Lo and behold!\\n\\nLookin’ for my lo and behold\\n\\nGet me outa here, my dear man!\\n\\n\\n\\nI bought my girl\\n\\nA herd of moose\\n\\nOne she could call her own\\n\\nWell, she came out the very next day\\n\\nTo see where they had flown\\n\\nI’m goin’ down to Tennessee\\n\\nGet me a truck ‘r somethin’\\n\\nGonna save my money and rip it up!\\n\\nLo and behold!

Lo and behold!\\n\\nLookin’ for my lo and behold\\n\\nGet me outa here, my dear man!\\n\\nOld man sailin’ in a dinghy boat\\n\\nDown there\\n\\nOld man down is baitin’ a hook\\n\\nOn there\\n\\nGonna

the neighbor\\n\\n“It’s just somethin’ we’re gonna have to forget”\\n\\n“Yes, I guess so,” said Ma\\n\\nThen she asked me if the clothes was still wet\\n\\n\\n\\nI reached up, touched my shirt\\n\\nAnd the neighbor said, “Are those clothes yours?”\\n\\nI said, “Some of ’em, not all of ’em”\\n\\nHe said, “Ya always help out around here with the chores?”\\n\\nI said, “Sometime, not all the time”\\n\\nThen my neighbor, he blew his nose\\n\\nJust as Papa yelled outside\\n\\n“Mama wants you t’ come back in the house and bring them clothes”\\n\\nWell, I just do what I’m told\\n\\nSo, I did it, of course\\n\\nI went back in the house and Mama met me\\n\\nAnd then I shut all the doors\\nCopyright © 1969 by Dwarf Music; renewed 19\\n\\nNothing was delivered\\n\\nAnd I tell this truth

upper hall\\n\\nShe sees the bartender in a pool of blood\\n\\nCries out, “My God, they killed them all!”\\n\\nHere comes the story of the Hurricane\\n\\nThe man the authorities came to blame\\n\\nFor somethin’ that he never done\\n\\nPut in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been\\n\\nThe champion of the world\\n\\n\\n\\nThree bodies lyin’ there does Patty see\\n\\nAnd another man named Bello, movin’ around mysteriously\\n\\n“I didn’t do it,” he says, and he throws up his hands\\n\\n“I was only robbin’ the register, I hope you understand\\n\\nI saw them leavin’,” he says, and he stops\\n\\n“One of us had better call up the cops”\\n\\nAnd so Patty calls the cops\\n\\nAnd they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin’\\n\\nIn the hot New Jersey night\\n\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, far away in another part of town\\n\\nRubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin’ around\\n\\nNumber one contender for the middleweight crown\\n\\nHad no idea what kinda shit was about to go down\\n\\nWhen a cop pulled him over to the side of the road\\n\\nJust like the time before and the time before that\\n\\nIn Paterson that’s just the way things go\\n\\nIf you’re black you might as well not show up on the street\\n\\n’Less you wanna draw the heat\\n\\n\\n\\nAlfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops\\n\\nHim and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin’ around\\n\\nHe said, “I saw two men runnin’ out, they looked like middleweights\\n\\nThey jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates”\\n\\nAnd Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head\\n\\nCop said, “Wait a minute, boys, this one’s not dead”\\n\\nSo they took him to the infirmary\\n\\nAnd though this man could hardly see\\n\\nThey told him that he could identify the guilty men\\n\\n\\n\\nFour in the mornin’ and they haul Rubin in\\n\\nTake him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs\\n\\nThe wounded man looks up through his one dyin’ eye\\n\\nSays, “Wha’d you bring him in here for? He ain’t the guy!”\\n\\nYes, here’s the story of the Hurricane\\n\\nThe man the authorities came to blame\\n\\nFor somethin’ that he never done\\n\\nPut in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been\\n\\nThe champion of the world\\n\\n\\n\\nFour months later, the ghettos are in flame\\n\\nRubin’s in South America, fightin’ for his name\\n\\nWhile Arthur Dexter Bradley’s still in the robbery game\\n\\nAnd the cops are puttin’ the screws to him, lookin’ for somebody to blame\\n\\n“Remember that murder that happened in a bar?”\\n\\n“Remember you said you saw the getaway car?”\\n\\n“You think you’d like to play ball with the law?”\\n\\n“Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin’ that night?”\\n\\n“Don’t forget that you are white”\\n\\n\\n\\nArthur Dexter Bradley said, “I’m really not sure”\\n\\nCops said, “A poor boy like you could use a break\\n\\nWe got you for the motel job and we’re talkin’ to your friend Bello\\n\\nNow you don’t wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow\\n\\nYou’ll be doin’ society a favor\\n\\nThat sonofabitch is brave and gettin’ braver\\n\\nWe want to put his ass in stir\\n\\nWe want to pin this triple murder on him\\n\\nHe ain’t no Gentleman Jim”\\n\\n\\n\\nRubin could take a man out with just one punch\\n\\nBut he never did like to talk about it all that much\\n\\nIt’s my work, he’d say, and I do it for pay\\n\\nAnd when it’s over I’d just as soon go on my way\\n\\nUp to some paradise\\n\\nWhere the trout streams flow and the air is nice\\n\\nAnd ride a horse along a trail\\n\\nBut then they took him to the jailhouse\\n\\nWhere they try to turn a man into a mouse\\n\\n\\n\\nAll of Rubin’s cards were marked in advance\\n\\nThe trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance\\n\\nThe judge made Rubin’s witnesses drunkards from the slums\\n\\nTo the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum\\n\\nAnd to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger\\n\\nNo one doubted that he pulled the trigger\\n\\nAnd though they could not produce the gun\\n\\nThe D.A. said he was the one who did the deed\\n\\nAnd the all-white jury agreed\\n\\n\\n\\nRubin Carter was falsely tried\\n\\nThe crime was murder “one,” guess who testified?\\n\\nBello and Bradley and they both baldly lied\\n\\nAnd the newspapers, they all went along for the ride\\n\\nHow can the life of such a man\\n\\nBe in the palm of some fool’s hand?\\n\\nTo see him obviously framed\\n\\nCouldn’t help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land\\n\\nWhere justice is a game\\n\\n\\n\\nNow all the criminals in their coats and their ties\\n\\nAre free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise\\n\\nWhile Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell\\n\\nAn innocent man in a living hell\\n\\nThat’s the story of the Hurricane\\n\\nBut it won’t be over till they clear his name\\n\\nAnd give him back the time he’s done\\n\\nPut in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been\\n\\nThe champion of the world\\n\\n\\nI like to spend some time in Mozambique\\n\\nThe sunny sky is aqua blue\\n\\nAnd all the couples dancing cheek to cheek\\n\\nIt’s very nice to stay a week or two\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s lot of pretty girls in Mozambique\\n\\nAnd plenty time for good romance\\n\\nAnd everybody likes to stop and speak\\n\\nTo give the special one you seek a chance\\n\\nOr maybe say hello with just a glance\\n\\n\\n\\nLying next to her by the ocean\\n\\nReaching out and touching her hand\\n\\nWhispering your secret emotion\\n\\nMagic in a magical land\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd when it’s time for leaving Mozambique\\n\\nTo say goodbye to sand and sea\\n\\nYou turn around to take a final peek\\n\\nAnd you see why it’s so unique to be\\n\\nAmong the lovely people living free\\n\\nUpon the beach of sunny Mozambique\\n\\n\\nYour breath is sweet\\n\\nYour eyes are like two jewels in the sky\\n\\nYour back is straight, your hair is smooth\\n\\nOn the pillow where you lie\\n\\nBut I don’t sense affection\\n\\nNo gratitude or love\\n\\nYour loyalty is not to me\\n\\nBut to the stars above\\n\\n\\n\\nOne more cup of coffee for the road\\n\\nOne more cup of coffee ’fore I go\\n\\nTo the valley below\\n\\n\\n\\nYour daddy he’s an outlaw\\n\\nAnd a wanderer by trade\\n\\nHe’ll teach you how to pick and choose\\n\\nAnd how to throw the blade\\n\\nHe oversees his kingdom\\n\\nSo no stranger

below\\n\\n\\n\\nYour sister sees the future\\n\\nLike your mama and yourself\\n\\nYou’ve never learned to read or write\\n\\nThere’s no books upon your shelf\\n\\nAnd your pleasure knows no limits\\n\\nYour voice is like a meadowlark\\n\\nBut your heart is like an ocean\\n\\nMysterious and dark\\n\\n\\n\\nOne more cup of coffee for the road\\n\\nOne more cup of coffee ’fore I go\\n\\nTo the valley below\\n\\nI laid on a dune, I looked at the sky\\n\\nWhen the children were babies and played on the beach\\n\\nYou came up behind me, I saw you go by\\n\\nYou were always so close and still within reach\\n\\n\\n\\nSara, Sara\\n\\nWhatever made you want to change your mind?\\n\\nSara, Sara\\n\\nSo easy to look at, so hard to define\\n\\n\\n\\nI can still see them playin’ with their pails in the sand\\n\\nThey run to the water their buckets to fill\\n\\nI can still see the shells fallin’ out of their hands\\n\\nAs they follow each other back up the hill\\n\\n\\n\\nSara, Sara\\n\\nSweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life\\n\\nSara, Sara\\n\\nRadiant jewel, mystical wife\\n\\n\\n\\nSleepin’ in the woods by a fire in the night\\n\\nDrinkin’ white rum in a Portugal bar\\n\\nThem playin’ leapfrog and hearin’ about Snow White\\n\\nYou in the marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar\\n\\n\\n\\nSara, Sara\\n\\nIt’s all so clear, I could never forget\\n\\nSara, Sara\\n\\nLovin’ you is the one thing I’ll never regret\\n\\n\\n\\nI can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells\\n\\nI’d taken the cure and had just gotten through\\n\\nStayin’ up for days in the Chelsea Hotel\\n\\nWritin’ “Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands” for you\\n\\n\\n\\nSara, Sara\\n\\nWherever we travel we’re never apart\\n\\nSara, oh Sara\\n\\nBeautiful lady, so dear to my heart\\n\\n\\n\\nHow did I meet you? I don’t know\\n\\nA messenger sent me in a tropical storm\\n\\nYou were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow\\n\\nAnd on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm\\n\\n\\n\\nSara, oh Sara\\n\\nScorpio Sphinx in a calico dress\\n\\nSara, Sara\\n\\nYou must forgive me my unworthiness\\n\\n\\n\\nNow the beach is deserted except for some kelp\\n\\nAnd a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore\\n\\nYou always responded when I needed your help\\n\\nYou gimme a map and a key to your door\\n\\n\\n\\nSara, oh Sara\\n\\nGlamorous nymph with an arrow and bow\\n\\nSara, oh Sara\\n\\nDon’t ever leave me, don’t ever go\\n\\n\\nI married Isis on the fifth day of May\\n\\nBut I could not hold on to her very long\\n\\nSo I cut off my hair and I rode straight away\\n\\nFor the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong\\n\\n\\n\\nI came to a high place of darkness and light\\n\\nThe dividing line ran through the center of town\\n\\nI hitched up my pony to a post on the right\\n\\nWent in to a laundry to wash my clothes down\\n\\n\\n\\nA man in the corner approached me for a match\\n\\nI knew right away he was not ordinary\\n\\nHe said, “Are you lookin’ for somethin’ easy to catch?”\\n\\nI said, “I got no money.” He said, “That ain’t necessary”\\n\\n\\n\\nWe set out that night for the cold in the North\\n\\nI gave him my blanket, he gave me his word\\n\\nI said, “Where are we goin’?” He said we’d be back by the fourth\\n\\nI said, “That’s the best news that I’ve ever heard”\\n\\n\\n\\nI was thinkin’ about turquoise, I was thinkin’ about gold\\n\\nI was thinkin’ about diamonds and the world’s biggest necklace\\n\\nAs we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold\\n\\nI was thinkin’ about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless\\n\\n\\n\\nHow she told me that one day we would meet up again\\n\\nAnd things would be different the next time we wed\\n\\nIf I only could hang on and just be her friend\\n\\nI still can’t remember all the best things she said\\n\\n\\n\\nWe came to the pyramids all embedded in ice\\n\\nHe said, “There’s a body I’m tryin’ to find\\n\\nIf I carry it out it’ll bring a good price”\\n\\n’Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind\\n\\n\\n\\nThe wind it was howlin’ and the snow was outrageous\\n\\nWe chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn\\n\\nWhen he died I was hopin’ that it wasn’t contagious\\n\\nBut I made up my mind that I had to go on\\n\\n\\n\\nI broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty\\n\\nThere was no jewels, no nothin’, I felt I’d been had\\n\\nWhen I saw that my partner was just bein’ friendly\\n\\nWhen I took up his offer I must-a been mad\\n\\n\\n\\nI picked up his body and I dragged him inside\\n\\nThrew him down in the hole and I put back the cover\\n\\nI said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied\\n\\nThen I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her\\n\\n\\n\\nShe was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise\\n\\nBlinded by sleep and in need of a bed\\n\\nI came in from the East with the sun in my eyes\\n\\nI cursed her one time then I rode on ahead\\n\\n\\n\\nShe said, “Where ya been?” I said, “No place special”\\n\\nShe said, “You look different.” I said, “Well, not quite”\\n\\nShe said, “You been gone.” I said, “That’s only natural”\\n\\nShe said, “You gonna stay?” I said, “Yeah, I jes might”\\n\\n\\n\\nIsis, oh, Isis, you mystical child\\n\\nWhat drives me to you is what drives me insane\\n\\nI still can remember the way that you smiled\\n\\nOn the fifth day of May in the drizzlin’ rain\\n\\nHot chili peppers in the blistering sun\\n\\nDust on my face and my cape\\n\\nMe and Magdalena on the run\\n\\nI think this time we shall escape\\n\\n\\n\\nSold my guitar to the baker’s son\\n\\nFor a few crumbs and a place to hide\\n\\nBut I can get another one\\n\\nAnd I’ll play for Magdalena as we ride\\n\\n\\n\\nNo llores, mi querida\\n\\nDios nos vigila\\n\\nSoon the horse will take us to Durango\\n\\nAgarrame, mi vida\\n\\nSoon the desert will be gone\\n\\nSoon you will be dancing the fandango\\n\\n\\n\\nPast the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people\\n\\nHoofbeats like castanets on stone\\n\\nAt night I dream of bells in the village steeple\\n\\nThen I see the bloody face of Ramon\\n\\n\\n\\nWas it me that shot him down in the cantina\\n\\nWas it my hand that held the gun?\\n\\nCome, let us fly, my Magdalena\\n\\nThe dogs are barking and what’s done is done\\n\\n\\n\\nNo Ilores, mi querida\\n\\nDios nos vigila\\n\\nSoon the horse will take us to Durango\\n\\nAgarrame, mi vida\\n\\nSoon the desert will be gone\\n\\nSoon you will be dancing the fandango\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the corrida we’ll sit in the shade\\n\\nAnd watch the young torero stand alone\\n\\nWe’ll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed\\n\\nWhen they rode with Villa into Torreón\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the padre will recite the prayers of old\\n\\nIn the little church this side of town\\n\\nI will wear new boots and an earring of gold\\n\\nYou’ll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown\\n\\n\\n\\nThe way is long but the end is near\\n\\nAlready the fiesta has begun\\n\\nThe face of God will appear\\n\\nWith His serpent eyes of obsidian\\n\\n\\n\\nNo Ilores, mi querida\\n\\nDio nos vigila\\n\\nSoon the horse will take us to Durango\\n\\nAgarrame, mi vida\\n\\nSoon the desert will be gone\\n\\nSoon you will be dancing the fandango\\n\\n\\n\\nWas that the thunder that I heard?\\n\\nMy head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain\\n\\nCome sit by me, don’t say a word\\n\\nOh, can it be that I am slain?\\n\\n\\n\\nQuick, Magdalena, take my gun\\n\\nLook up in the hills, that flash of light\\n\\nAim well my little one\\n\\nWe may not make it through the night\\n\\n\\n\\nNo Ilores, mi querida\\n\\nDios nos vigila\\n\\nSoon the horse will take us to Durango\\n\\nAgarrame, mi vida\\n\\nSoon the desert will be gone\\n\\nSoon you will be dancing the fandango\\n\\nUp on the white veranda\\n\\nShe wears a necktie and a Panama hat\\n\\nHer passport shows a face\\n\\nFrom another time and place\\n\\nShe looks nothin’ like that\\n\\nAnd all the remnants of her recent past\\n\\nAre scattered in the wild wind\\n\\nShe walks across the marble floor\\n\\nWhere a voice from the gambling room is callin’ her to come on in\\n\\nShe smiles, walks the other way\\n\\nAs the last ship sails and the moon fades away\\n\\nFrom Black Diamond Bay\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the mornin’ light breaks open, the Greek comes down\\n\\nAnd he asks for a rope and a pen that will write\\n\\n“Pardon, monsieur,” the desk clerk says\\n\\nCarefully removes his fez\\n\\n“Am I hearin’ you right?”\\n\\nAnd as the yellow fog is liftin’\\n\\nThe Greek is quickly headin’ for the second floor\\n\\nShe passes him on the spiral staircase\\n\\nThinkin’ he’s the Soviet Ambassador\\n\\nShe starts to speak, but he walks away\\n\\nAs the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway\\n\\nOn Black Diamond Bay\\n\\n\\n\\nA soldier sits beneath the fan\\n\\nDoin’ business with a tiny man who sells him a ring\\n\\nLightning strikes, the lights blow out\\n\\nThe desk clerk wakes and begins to shout\\n\\n“Can you see anything?”\\n\\nThen the Greek appears on the second floor\\n\\nIn his bare feet with a rope around his neck\\n\\nWhile a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle\\n\\nSays, “Open up another deck”\\n\\nBut the dealer says, “Attendez-vous, s’il vous plait”\\n\\nAs the rain beats down and the cranes fly away\\n\\nFrom Black Diamond Bay\\n\\n\\n\\nThe desk clerk heard the woman laugh\\n\\nAs he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough\\n\\nHe tried to grab the woman’s hand\\n\\nSaid, “Here’s a ring, it cost a grand”\\n\\nShe said, “That ain’t enough”\\n\\nThen she ran upstairs to pack her bags\\n\\nWhile a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb\\n\\nShe passed the door that the Greek had locked\\n\\nWhere a handwritten sign read, “Do Not Disturb”\\n\\nShe knocked upon it anyway\\n\\nAs the sun went down and the music did play\\n\\nOn Black Diamond Bay\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’ve got to talk to someone quick!”\\n\\nBut the Greek said, “Go away,” and he kicked the chair to the floor\\n\\nHe hung there from the chandelier\\n\\nShe cried, “Help, there’s danger near\\n\\nPlease open up the door!”\\n\\nThen the volcano erupted\\n\\nAnd the lava flowed down from the mountain high above\\n\\nThe soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner\\n\\nThinking of forbidden love\\n\\nBut the desk clerk said, “It happens every day”\\n\\nAs the stars fell down and the fields burned away\\n\\nOn Black Diamond Bay\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the island slowly sank\\n\\nThe loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room\\n\\nThe dealer said, “It’s too late now\\n\\nYou can take your money, but I don’t know how\\n\\nYou’ll spend it in the tomb”\\n\\nThe tiny man bit the soldier’s ear\\n\\nAs the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew\\n\\nWhile she’s out on the balcony, where a stranger tells her\\n\\n“My darling, je vous aime beaucoup”\\n\\nShe sheds a tear and then begins to pray\\n\\nAs the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away\\n\\nFrom Black Diamond Bay\\n\\n\\n\\nI was sittin’ home alone one night in L.A.\\n\\nWatchin’ old Cronkite on the seven o’clock news\\n\\nIt seems there was an earthquake that\\n\\nLeft nothin’ but a Panama hat\\n\\nAnd a pair of old Greek shoes\\n\\nDidn’t seem like much was happenin’,\\n\\nSo I turned it off and went to grab another beer\\n\\nSeems like every time you turn around\\n\\nThere’s another hard-luck story that you’re gonna hear\\n\\nAnd there’s really nothin’ anyone can say\\n\\nAnd I never did plan to go anyway\\n\\nTo Black Diamond Bay\\n\\nSeven days, seven more days she’ll be comin’\\n\\nI’ll be waiting at the station for her to arrive\\n\\nSeven more days, all I gotta do is survive\\n\\n\\n\\nShe been gone ever since I been a child\\n\\nEver since I seen her smile, I ain’t forgotten her eyes\\n\\nShe had a face that could outshine the sun in the skies\\n\\n\\n\\nI been good, I been good while I been waitin’\\n\\nMaybe guilty of hesitatin’, I just been holdin’ on\\n\\nSeven more days, all that’ll be gone\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s kissing in the valley\\n\\nThieving in the alley\\n\\nFighting every inch of the way\\n\\nTrying to be tender\\n\\nWith somebody I remember\\n\\nIn a night that’s always brighter’n the day\\n\\n\\n\\nSeven days, seven more days that are connected\\n\\nJust like I expected, she’ll be comin’ on forth\\n\\nMy beautiful comrade from the north\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s kissing in the valley\\n\\nThieving in the alley\\n\\nFighting every inch of the way\\n\\nTrying to be tender\\n\\nWith somebody I remember\\n\\nIn a night that’s always brighter’n the day\\n\\nBorn in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when\\n\\nOpened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion\\n\\nAlways on the outside of whatever side there was\\n\\nWhen they asked him why it had to be that way, “Well,” he answered,\\n\\n    “just because”\\n\\n\\n\\nLarry was the oldest, Joey was next to last\\n\\nThey called Joe “Crazy,” the baby they called “Kid Blast”\\n\\nSome say they lived off gambling and runnin’ numbers too\\n\\nIt always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue\\n\\n\\n\\nJoey, Joey\\n\\nKing of the streets, child of clay\\n\\nJoey, Joey\\n\\nWhat made them want to come and blow you away?\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that\\n\\nNo one ever knew for sure where they were really at\\n\\nWhen they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost hit the roof\\n\\nHe went out that night to seek revenge, thinkin’ he was bulletproof\\n\\n\\n\\nThe war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets\\n\\nJoey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats\\n\\nTill they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners\\n\\nThey stashed them away in a basement, called them amateurs\\n\\n\\n\\nThe hostages were tremblin’ when they heard a man exclaim\\n\\n“Let’s blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame”\\n\\nBut Joey stepped up, he raised his hand, said, “We’re not those kind of men\\n\\nIt’s peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again”\\n\\n\\n\\nJoey, Joey\\n\\nKing of the streets, child of clay\\n\\nJoey, Joey\\n\\nWhat made them want to come and blow you away?\\n\\n\\n\\nThe police department hounded him, they called him Mr. Smith\\n\\nThey got him on conspiracy, they were never sure who with\\n\\n“What time is it?” said the judge to Joey when they met\\n\\n“Five to ten,” said Joey. The judge says, “That’s exactly what you get”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich\\n\\nThey threw him in the hole one time for tryin’ to stop a strike\\n\\nHis closest friends were black men ’cause they seemed to understand\\n\\nWhat it’s like to be in society with a shackle on your hand\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen they let him out in ’71 he’d lost a little weight\\n\\nBut he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great\\n\\nHe tried to find the way back into the life he left behind\\n\\nTo the boss he said, “I have returned and now I want what’s mine”\\n\\n\\n\\nJoey, Joey\\n\\nKing of the streets, child of clay\\n\\nJoey, Joey\\n\\nWhy did they have to come and blow you away?\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun\\n\\n“I’m around too many children,” he’d say, “they should never know of one”\\n\\nYet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe\\n\\nEmptied out the register, said, “Tell ’em it was Crazy Joe”\\n\\n\\n\\nOne day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York\\n\\nHe could see it comin’ through the door as he lifted up his fork\\n\\nHe pushed the table over to protect his family\\n\\nThen he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy\\n\\n\\n\\nJoey, Joey\\n\\nKing of the streets, child of clay\\n\\nJoey, Joey\\n\\nWhat made them want to come and blow you away?\\n\\n\\n\\nSister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep\\n\\nI heard his best friend Frankie say, “He ain’t dead, he’s just asleep”\\n\\nThen I saw the old man’s limousine head back towards the grave\\n\\nI guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned\\n\\nThey said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born\\n\\nAnd someday if God’s in heaven overlookin’ His preserve\\n\\nI know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve\\n\\n\\n\\nJoey, Joey\\n\\nKing of the streets, child of clay\\n\\nJoey, Joey\\n\\nWhat made them want to come and blow you away?\\n\\nOh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms\\n\\nYou should not treat me like a stranger\\n\\nOur Father would not like the way that you act\\n\\nAnd you must realize the danger\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, sister, am I not a brother to you\\n\\nAnd one deserving of affection?\\n\\nAnd is our purpose not the same on this earth\\n\\nTo love and follow His direction?\\n\\n\\n\\nWe grew up together\\n\\nFrom the cradle to the grave\\n\\nWe died and were reborn\\n\\nAnd then mysteriously saved\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, sister, when I come to knock on your door\\n\\nDon’t turn away, you’ll create sorrow\\n\\nTime is an ocean but it ends at the shore\\n\\nYou may not see me tomorrow\\n\\n\\nYou been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe\\n\\nBut you’re back where you belong\\n\\nGo get me my pistol, babe\\n\\nHoney, I can’t tell right from wrong\\n\\n\\n\\nBaby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying\\n\\nBaby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying\\n\\nBaby, please stop crying\\n\\nYou know, I know, the sun will always shine\\n\\nSo baby, please stop crying ’cause it’s tearing up my mind\\n\\n\\n\\nGo down to the river, babe\\n\\nHoney, I will meet you there\\n\\nGo down to the river, babe\\n\\nHoney, I will pay your fare\\n\\n\\n\\nBaby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying\\n\\nBaby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying\\n\\nBaby, please stop crying\\n\\nYou know, I know, the sun will always shine\\n\\nSo baby, please stop crying ’cause it’s tearing up my mind\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you’re looking for assistance, babe\\n\\nOr if you just want some company\\n\\nOr if you just want a friend you can talk to\\n\\nHoney, come and see about me\\n\\n\\n\\nBaby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying\\n\\nBaby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying\\n\\nBaby, please stop crying\\n\\nYou know, I know, the sun will always shine\\n\\nSo baby, please stop crying ’cause it’s tearing up my mind\\n\\n\\n\\nYou been hurt so many times\\n\\nAnd I know what you’re thinking of\\n\\nWell, I don’t have to be no doctor, babe\\n\\nTo see that you’re madly in love\\n\\n\\n\\nBaby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying\\n\\nBaby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying\\n\\nBaby, please stop crying\\n\\nYou know, I know, the sun will always shine\\n\\nSo baby, please stop crying ’cause it’s tearing up my mind\\n\\nDo you love me, or are you just extending goodwill?\\n\\nDo you need me half as bad as you say, or are you just feeling guilt?\\n\\nI’ve been burned before and I know the score\\n\\nSo you won’t hear me complain\\n\\nWill I be able to count on you\\n\\nOr is your love in vain?\\n\\n\\n\\nAre you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?\\n\\nWhen I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?\\n\\nDo you know my world, do you know my kind\\n\\nOr must I explain?\\n\\nWill you let me be myself\\n\\nOr is your love in vain?\\n\\n\\n\\nWell I’ve been to the mountain and I’ve been in the wind\\n\\nI’ve been in and out of happiness\\n\\nI have dined with kings, I’ve been offered wings\\n\\nAnd I’ve never been too impressed\\n\\n\\n\\nAll right, I’ll take a chance, I will fall in love with you\\n\\nIf I’m a fool you can have the night, you can have the morning too\\n\\nCan you cook and sew, make flowers grow\\n\\nDo you understand my pain?\\n\\nAre you willing to risk it all\\n\\nOr is your love in vain?\\n\\nSeñor, señor, do you know where we’re headin’?\\n\\nLincoln County Road or Armageddon?\\n\\nSeems like I been down this way before\\n\\nIs there any truth in that, señor?\\n\\n\\n\\nSeñor, señor, do you know where she is hidin’?\\n\\nHow long are we gonna be ridin’?\\n\\nHow long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?\\n\\nWill there be any comfort there, señor?\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s a wicked wind still blowin’ on that upper deck\\n\\nThere’s an iron cross still hangin\\' down from around her neck\\n\\nThere’s a marchin’ band still playin’ in that vacant lot\\n\\nWhere she held me in her arms one time and said, “Forget me not”\\n\\n\\n\\nSeñor, señor, I can see that painted wagon\\n\\nI can smell the tail of the dragon\\n\\nCan’t stand the suspense anymore\\n\\nCan you tell me who to contact here, señor?\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled\\n\\nWas that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field\\n\\nA gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring\\n\\nSaid, “Son, this ain’t a dream no more, it’s the real thing”\\n\\n\\n\\nSeñor, señor, you know their hearts is as hard as leather\\n\\nWell, give me a minute, let me get it together\\n\\nI just gotta pick myself up off the floor\\n\\nI’m ready when you are, señor\\n\\n\\n\\nSeñor, señor, let’s disconnect these cables\\n\\nOverturn these tables\\n\\nThis place don’t make sense to me no more\\n\\nCan you tell me what we’re waiting for, señor?\\n\\nOnce I had a pony, her name was Lucifer\\n\\nI had a pony, her name was Lucifer\\n\\nShe broke her leg and she needed shooting\\n\\nI swear it hurt me more than it could ever have hurted her\\n\\n\\n\\nSometimes I wonder what’s going on in the mind of Miss X\\n\\nSometimes I wonder what’s going on in the mind of Miss X\\n\\nYou know she got such a sweet disposition\\n\\nI never know what the poor girl’s gonna do to me next\\n\\n\\n\\nI got a new pony, she knows how to fox-trot, lope and pace\\n\\nWell, I got a new pony, she knows how to fox-trot, lope and pace\\n\\nShe got great big hind legs\\n\\nAnd long black shaggy hair above her face\\n\\n\\n\\nWell now, it was early in the mornin’, I seen your shadow in the door\\n\\nIt was early in the mornin’, I seen your shadow in the door\\n\\nNow, I don’t have to ask nobody\\n\\nI know what you come here for\\n\\n\\n\\nThey say you’re usin’ voodoo, your feet walk by themselves\\n\\nThey say you’re usin’ voodoo, I seen your feet walk by themselves\\n\\nOh, baby, that god you been prayin’ to\\n\\nIs gonna give ya back what you’re wishin’ on someone else\\n\\n\\n\\nCome over here pony, I, I wanna climb up one time on you\\n\\nCome over here pony, I, I wanna climb up one time on you\\n\\nWell, you’re so bad and nasty\\n\\nBut I love you, yes I do\\n\\nIn death, you face life with a child and a wife\\n\\nWho sleep-walks through your dreams into walls\\n\\nYou’re a soldier of mercy, you’re cold and you curse\\n\\n“He who cannot be trusted must fall”\\n\\n\\n\\nLoneliness, tenderness, high society, notoriety\\n\\nYou fight for the throne and you travel alone\\n\\nUnknown as you slowly sink\\n\\nAnd there’s no time to think\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the Federal City you been blown and shown pity\\n\\nIn secret, for pieces of change\\n\\nThe empress attracts you but oppression distracts you\\n\\nAnd it makes you feel violent and strange\\n\\n\\n\\nMemory, ecstasy, tyranny, hypocrisy\\n\\nBetrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss\\n\\nIn the valley of the missing link\\n\\nAnd you have no time to think\\n\\n\\n\\nJudges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you\\n\\nHer worst is better than best\\n\\nI’ve seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes\\n\\nAnd I feel so depressed\\n\\n\\n\\nChina doll, alcohol, duality, mortality\\n\\nMercury rules you and destiny fools you\\n\\nLike the plague, with a dangerous wink\\n\\nAnd there’s no time to think\\n\\n\\n\\nYour conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you\\n\\nWhere the lion lies down with the lamb\\n\\nI’d have paid off the traitor and killed him much later\\n\\nBut that’s just the way that I am\\n\\n\\n\\nParadise, sacrifice, mortality, reality\\n\\nBut the magician is quicker and his game\\n\\nIs much thicker than blood and blacker than ink\\n\\nAnd there’s no time to think\\n\\n\\n\\nAnger and jealousy’s all that he sells us\\n\\nHe’s content when you’re under his thumb\\n\\nMadmen oppose him, but your kindness throws him\\n\\nTo survive it you play deaf and dumb\\n\\n\\n\\nEquality, liberty, humility, simplicity\\n\\nYou glance through the mirror and there’s eyes staring clear\\n\\nAt the back of your head as you drink\\n\\nAnd there’s no time to think\\n\\n\\n\\nWarlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow\\n\\nWill offer their heads for a prayer\\n\\nYou can’t find no salvation, you have no expectations\\n\\nAnytime, anyplace, anywhere\\n\\n\\n\\nMercury, gravity, nobility, humility\\n\\nYou know you can’t keep her and the water gets deeper\\n\\nThat is leading you onto the brink\\n\\nBut there’s no time to think\\n\\n\\n\\nYou’ve murdered your vanity, buried your sanity\\n\\nFor pleasure you must now resist\\n\\nLovers obey you but they cannot sway you\\n\\nThey’re not even sure you exist\\n\\n\\n\\nSocialism, hypnotism, patriotism, materialism\\n\\nFools making laws for the breaking of jaws\\n\\nAnd the sound of the keys as they clink\\n\\nBut there’s no time to think\\n\\n\\n\\nThe bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl\\n\\nWith the rose in her hair\\n\\nStarlight in the East and you’re finally released\\n\\nYou’re stranded but with nothing to share\\n\\n\\n\\nLoyalty, unity, epitome, rigidity\\n\\nYou turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille\\n\\n’Neath the moon shinin’ bloody and pink\\n\\nAnd there’s no time to think\\n\\n\\n\\nBullets can harm you and death can disarm you\\n\\nBut no, you will not be deceived\\n\\nStripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt\\n\\nYou can give but you cannot receive\\n\\n\\n\\nNo time to choose when the truth must die\\n\\nNo time to lose or say goodbye\\n\\nNo time to prepare for the victim that’s there\\n\\nNo time to suffer or blink\\n\\nAnd no time to think\\n\\nI’m getting weary looking in my baby’s eyes\\n\\nWhen she’s near me she’s so hard to recognize\\n\\nI finally realize there’s no room for regret\\n\\nTrue love, true love, true love tends to forget\\n\\n\\n\\nHold me, baby be near\\n\\nYou told me that you’d be sincere\\n\\nEvery day of the year’s like playin’ Russian roulette\\n\\nTrue love, true love, true love tends to forget\\n\\n\\n\\nI was lyin’ down in the reeds without any oxygen\\n\\nI saw you in the wilderness among the men\\n\\nSaw you drift into infinity and come back again\\n\\nAll you got to do is wait and I’ll tell you when\\n\\n\\n\\nYou’re a tearjerker, baby, but I’m under your spell\\n\\nYou’re a hard worker, baby, and I know you well\\n\\nBut this weekend in hell is making me sweat\\n\\nTrue love, true love, true love tends to forget\\n\\n\\n\\nI was lyin’ down in the reeds without any oxygen\\n\\nI saw you in the wilderness among the men\\n\\nSaw you drift into infinity and come back again\\n\\nAll you got to do is wait and I’ll tell you when\\n\\n\\n\\nYou belong to me, baby, without any doubt\\n\\nDon’t forsake me, baby, don’t sell me out\\n\\nDon’t keep me knockin’ about from Mexico to Tibet\\n\\nTrue love, true love, true love tends to forget\\n\\nI think we better talk this over\\n\\nMaybe when we both get sober\\n\\nYou’ll understand I’m only a man\\n\\nDoin’ the best that I can\\n\\n\\n\\nThis situation can only get rougher\\n\\nWhy should we needlessly suffer?\\n\\nLet’s call it a day, go our own different ways\\n\\nBefore we decay\\n\\n\\n\\nYou don’t have to be afraid of looking into my face\\n\\nWe’ve done nothing to each other time will not erase\\n\\n\\n\\nI feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling\\n\\nYou been two-faced, you been double-dealing\\n\\nI took a chance, got caught in the trance\\n\\nOf a downhill dance\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, child, why you wanna hurt me?\\n\\nI’m exiled, you can’t convert me\\n\\nI’m lost in the haze of your delicate ways\\n\\nWith both eyes glazed\\n\\n\\n\\nYou don’t have to yearn for love, you don’t have to be alone\\n\\nSomewheres in this universe there’s a place that you can call home\\n\\n\\n\\nI guess I’ll be leaving tomorrow\\n\\nIf I have to beg, steal or borrow\\n\\nIt’d be great to cross paths in a day and a half\\n\\nLook at each other and laugh\\n\\n\\n\\nBut I don’t think it’s liable to happen\\n\\nLike the sound of one hand clappin’\\n\\nThe vows that we kept are now broken and swept\\n\\n’Neath the bed where we slept\\n\\n\\n\\nDon’t think of me and fantasize on what we never had\\n\\nBe grateful for what we’ve shared together and be glad\\n\\nWhy should we go on watching each other through a telescope?\\n\\nEventually we’ll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, babe, time for a new transition\\n\\nI wish I was a magician\\n\\nI would wave a wand and tie back the bond\\n\\nThat we’ve both gone beyond\\n\\nThere’s a long-distance train rolling through the rain\\n\\nTears on the letter I write\\n\\nThere’s a woman I long to touch and I miss her so much\\n\\nBut she’s drifting like a satellite\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s a neon light ablaze in this green smoky haze\\n\\nLaughter down on Elizabeth Street\\n\\nAnd a lonesome bell tone in that valley of stone\\n\\nWhere she bathed in a stream of pure heat\\n\\n\\n\\nHer father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise\\n\\nBut he practiced what he preached from the heart\\n\\nA full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted to me\\n\\nThe time and the place that the trouble would start\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage\\n\\nAnd a longtime golden-haired stripper onstage\\n\\nAnd she winds back the clock and she turns back the page\\n\\nOf a book that no one can write\\n\\nOh, where are you tonight?\\n\\n\\n\\nThe truth was obscure, too profound and too pure\\n\\nTo live it you have to explode\\n\\nIn that last hour of need, we entirely agreed\\n\\nSacrifice was the code of the road\\n\\n\\n\\nI left town at dawn, with Marcel and St. John\\n\\nStrong men belittled by doubt\\n\\nI couldn’t tell her what my private thoughts were\\n\\nBut she had some way of finding them out\\n\\n\\n\\nHe took dead-center aim but he missed just the same\\n\\nShe was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf\\n\\nShe could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair\\n\\nAnd discovered her invisible self\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s a lion in the road, there’s a demon escaped\\n\\nThere’s a million dreams gone, there’s a landscape being raped\\n\\nAs her beauty fades and I watch her undrape\\n\\nI won’t but then again, maybe I might\\n\\nOh, if I could just find you tonight\\n\\n\\n\\nI fought with my twin, that enemy within\\n\\n’Til both of us fell by the way\\n\\nHorseplay and disease is killing me by degrees\\n\\nWhile the law looks the other way\\n\\n\\n\\nYour partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes\\n\\nThe guy you were lovin’ couldn’t stay clean\\n\\nIt felt outa place, my foot in his face\\n\\nBut he should-a stayed where his money was green\\n\\n\\n\\nI bit into the root of forbidden fruit\\n\\nWith the juice running down my leg\\n\\nThen I dealt with your boss, who’d never known about loss\\n\\nAnd who always was too proud to beg\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s a white diamond gloom on the dark side of this room\\n\\nAnd a pathway that leads up to the stars\\n\\nIf you don’t believe there’s a price for this sweet paradise\\n\\nRemind me to show you the scars\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s a new day at dawn and I’ve finally arrived\\n\\nIf I’m there in the morning, baby, you’ll know I’ve survived\\n\\nI can’t believe it, I can’t believe I’m alive\\n\\nBut without you it just doesn’t seem right\\n\\nOh, where are you tonight?\\n\\n\\nSixteen years\\n\\nSixteen banners united over the field\\n\\nWhere the good shepherd grieves\\n\\nDesperate men, desperate women divided\\n\\nSpreading their wings ’neath the falling leaves\\n\\n\\n\\nFortune calls\\n\\nI stepped forth from the shadows, to the marketplace\\n\\nMerchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down\\n\\nShe’s smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born\\n\\nOn midsummer’s eve, near the tower\\n\\n\\n\\nThe cold-blooded moon\\n\\nThe captain waits above the celebration\\n\\nSending his thoughts to a beloved maid\\n\\nWhose ebony face is beyond communication\\n\\nThe captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid\\n\\n\\n\\nThey shaved her head\\n\\nShe was torn between Jupiter and Apollo\\n\\nA messenger arrived with a black nightingale\\n\\nI seen her on the stairs and I couldn’t help but follow\\n\\nFollow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil\\n\\n\\n\\nI stumbled to my feet\\n\\nI rode past destruction in the ditches\\n\\nWith the stitches still mending ’neath a heart-shaped tattoo\\n\\nRenegade priests and treacherous young witches\\n\\nWere handing out the flowers that I’d given to you\\n\\n\\n\\nThe palace of mirrors\\n\\nWhere dog soldiers are reflected\\n\\nThe endless road and the wailing of chimes\\n\\nThe empty rooms where her memory is protected\\n\\nWhere the angels’ voices whisper to the souls of previous times\\n\\n\\n\\nShe wakes him up\\n\\nForty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking\\n\\nNear broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks\\n\\nShe’s begging to know what measures he now will be taking\\n\\nHe’s pulling her down and she’s clutching on to his long golden locks\\n\\n\\n\\nGentlemen, he said\\n\\nI don’t need your organization, I’ve shined your shoes\\n\\nI’ve moved your mountains and marked your cards\\n\\nBut Eden is burning, either brace yourself for elimination\\n\\nOr else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards\\n\\n\\n\\nPeace will come\\n\\nWith tranquillity and splendor on the wheels of fire\\n\\nBut will bring us no reward when her false idols fall\\n\\nAnd cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating\\n\\nBetween the King and the Queen of Swords\\n\\nYou harbor resentment\\n\\nYou know there ain’t too much of a thrill\\n\\nYou wish for contentment\\n\\nBut you got an emptiness that can’t be filled\\n\\nYou’ve had enough of hatred\\n\\nYour bones are breaking, can’t find nothing sacred\\n\\n\\n\\nYe shall be changed, ye shall be changed\\n\\nIn a twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet blows\\n\\nThe dead will arise and burst out of your clothes\\n\\nAnd ye shall be changed\\n\\n\\n\\nEverything you’ve gotten\\n\\nYou’ve gotten by sweat, blood and muscle\\n\\nFrom early in the morning ’til way past dark\\n\\nAll you ever do is hustle\\n\\nAll your loved ones have walked out the door\\n\\nYou’re not even sure ’bout your wife and kids no more, but\\n\\n\\n\\nYe shall be changed, ye shall be changed\\n\\nIn a twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet blows\\n\\nThe dead will arise and burst out of your clothes\\n\\nAnd ye shall be changed\\n\\n\\n\\nThe past don’t control you\\n\\nBut the future’s like a roulette wheel spinning\\n\\nDeep down inside\\n\\nYou know you need a whole new beginning\\n\\nDon’t have to go to Russia or Iran\\n\\nJust surrender to God and He’ll move you right here where you stand, and\\n\\n\\n\\nYe shall be changed, ye shall be changed\\n\\nIn a twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet blows\\n\\nThe dead will arise and burst out of your clothes\\n\\nAnd ye shall be changed\\n\\n\\n\\nYou drink bitter water\\n\\nAnd you been eating the bread of sorrow\\n\\nYou can’t live for today\\n\\nWhen all you’re ever thinking of is tomorrow\\n\\nThe path you’ve endured has been rough\\n\\nWhen you’ve decided that you’ve had enough, then\\n\\n\\n\\nYe shall be changed, ye shall be changed\\n\\nIn a twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet blows\\n\\nThe dead will arise and burst out of your clothes\\n\\nAnd ye shall be changed\\n\\nYou may be an ambassador to England or France\\n\\nYou may like to gamble, you might like to dance\\n\\nYou may be the heavyweight champion of the

He was supposed to feel bad\\n\\nHe’s the neighborhood bully\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, the chances are against it and the odds are slim\\n\\nThat he’ll live by the rules that the world makes for him\\n\\n’Cause there’s a noose at his neck and a gun at his back\\n\\nAnd a license to kill him is given out to every maniac\\n\\nHe’s the neighborhood bully\\n\\n\\n\\nHe got no allies to really speak of\\n\\nWhat he gets he must pay for, he don’t get it out of love\\n\\nHe buys obsolete weapons and he won’t be denied\\n\\nBut no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side\\n\\nHe’s the neighborhood bully\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, he’s surrounded by pacifists who all want peace\\n\\nThey pray for it nightly that the bloodshed must cease\\n\\nNow, they wouldn’t hurt a fly. To hurt one they would weep\\n\\nThey lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep\\n\\nHe’s the neighborhood bully\\n\\n\\n\\nEvery empire that’s enslaved him is gone\\n\\nEgypt and Rome, even the great Babylon\\n\\nHe’s made a garden of paradise in the desert sand\\n\\nIn bed with nobody, under no one’s command\\n\\nHe’s the neighborhood bully\\n\\n\\n\\nNow his holiest books have been trampled upon\\n\\nNo contract he signed was worth what it was written on\\n\\nHe took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth\\n\\nTook sickness and disease and he turned it into health\\n\\nHe’s the neighborhood bully\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat’s anybody indebted to him for?\\n\\nNothin’, they say. He just likes to cause war\\n\\nPride and prejudice and superstition indeed\\n\\nThey wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed\\n\\nHe’s the neighborhood bully\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat has he done to wear so many scars?\\n\\nDoes he change the course of rivers? Does he pollute the moon and stars?\\n\\nNeighborhood bully, standing on the hill\\n\\nRunning out the clock, time standing still\\n\\nNeighborhood bully\\n\\nLook out across the fields, see me returning\\n\\nSmoke is in your eye, you draw a smile\\n\\nFrom the fireplace where my letters to you are burning\\n\\nYou’ve had time to think about it for a while\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I’ve walked two hundred miles, now look me over\\n\\nIt’s the end of the chase and the moon is high\\n\\nIt won’t matter who loves who\\n\\nYou’ll love me or I’ll love you\\n\\nWhen the night comes falling from the sky\\n\\n\\n\\nI can see through your walls and I know you’re hurting\\n\\nSorrow covers you up like a cape\\n\\nOnly yesterday I know that you’ve been flirting\\n\\nWith disaster that you managed to escape\\n\\n\\n\\nI can’t provide for you no easy answers\\n\\nWho are you that I should have to lie?\\n\\nYou’ll know all about it, love\\n\\nIt’ll fit you like a glove\\n\\nWhen the night comes falling from the sky\\n\\n\\n\\nI can hear your trembling heart beat like a river\\n\\nYou must have been protecting someone last time I called.\\n\\nI’ve never asked you for nothing you couldn’t deliver\\n\\nI’ve never asked you to set yourself up for a fall\\n\\n\\n\\nI saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness\\n\\nFor the love of a lousy buck, I’ve watched them die\\n\\nStick around, baby, we’re not through\\n\\nDon’t look for me, I’ll see you\\n\\nWhen the night comes falling from the sky\\n\\n\\n\\nIn your teardrops, I can see my own reflection\\n\\nIt was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line\\n\\nI don’t want to be a fool starving for affection\\n\\nI don’t want to drown in someone else’s wine\\n\\n\\n\\nFor all eternity I think I will remember\\n\\nThat icy wind that’s howling in your eye\\n\\nYou will seek me and you’ll find me\\n\\nIn the wasteland of your mind\\n\\nWhen the night comes falling from the sky\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I sent you my feelings in a letter\\n\\nBut you were gambling for support\\n\\nThis time tomorrow I’ll know you better\\n\\nWhen my memory is not so short\\n\\n\\n\\nThis time I’m asking for freedom\\n\\nFreedom from a world which you deny\\n\\nAnd you’ll give it to me now\\n\\nI’ll take it anyhow\\n\\nWhen the night comes falling from the sky\\n\\nNow you’re here beside me, baby\\n\\nYou’re a living dream\\n\\nAnd every time you get this close\\n\\nIt makes me want to scream\\n\\nYou touched me and you knew\\n\\nThat I was warm for you and then\\n\\nI ain’t never gonna be the same again\\n\\n\\n\\nSorry if I hurt you, baby\\n\\nSorry if I did\\n\\nSorry if I touched the place\\n\\nWhere your secrets are hid\\n\\nBut you meant more than everything\\n\\nAnd I could not pretend\\n\\nI ain’t never gonna be the same again\\n\\n\\n\\nYou give me something to think about, baby\\n\\nEvery time I see ya\\n\\nDon’t worry, baby, I don’t mind leaving\\n\\nI’d just like it to be my idea\\n\\n\\n\\nYou taught me how to love you, baby\\n\\nYou taught me, oh, so well\\n\\nNow, I can’t go back to what was, baby\\n\\nI can’t unring the bell\\n\\nYou took my reality\\n\\nAnd cast it to the wind\\n\\nAnd I ain’t never gonna be the same again\\n\\nSomething is burning, baby, are you aware?\\n\\nSomething is the matter, baby, there’s smoke in your hair\\n\\nAre you still my friend, baby, show me a sign\\n\\nIs the love in your heart for me turning blind?\\n\\n\\n\\nYou’ve been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while\\n\\nThe truth that I’m seeking is in your missing file\\n\\nWhat’s your position, baby, what’s going on?\\n\\nWhy is the light in your eyes nearly gone?\\n\\n\\n\\nI know everything about this place, or so it seems\\n\\nAm I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?\\n\\nWell, it is so obvious that something has changed\\n\\nWhat’s happening, baby, to make you act so strange?\\n\\n\\n\\nSomething is burning, baby, here’s what I say\\n\\nEven the bloodhounds of London couldn’t find you today\\n\\nI see the shadow of a man, baby, makin’ you blue\\n\\nWho is he, baby, and what’s he to you?\\n\\n\\n\\nWe’ve reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins\\n\\nWhere charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins\\n\\nBut where do you live, baby, and where is the light?\\n\\nWhy are your eyes just staring off in the night?\\n\\n\\n\\nI can feel it in the night when I think of you\\n\\nI can feel it in the light and it’s got to be true\\n\\nYou can’t live by bread alone, you won’t be satisfied\\n\\nYou can’t roll away the stone if your hands are tied\\n\\n\\n\\nGot to start someplace, baby, can you explain?\\n\\nPlease don’t fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train\\n\\nAnswer me, baby, a casual look will do\\n\\nJust what in the world has come over you?\\n\\n\\n\\nI can feel it in the wind and it’s upside down\\n\\nI can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town\\n\\nI’ve had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve\\n\\nI don’t wanna see you bleed, I know what you need but it ain’t what you deserve\\n\\n\\n\\nSomething is burning, baby, something’s in flames\\n\\nThere’s a man going ’round calling names\\n\\nRing down when you’re ready, baby, I’m waiting for you\\n\\nI believe in the impossible, you know that I do\\n\\nCome baby, find me, come baby, remind me of where I once begun\\n\\nCome baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you’re the one\\n\\nI could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors\\n\\nBut I will always be emotionally yours\\n\\n\\n\\nCome baby, rock me, come baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart\\n\\nCome baby, teach me, come baby, reach me, let the music start\\n\\nI could be dreaming but I keep believing you’re the one I’m livin’ for\\n\\nAnd I will always be emotionally yours\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s like my whole life never happened\\n\\nWhen I see you, it’s as if I never had a thought\\n\\nI know this dream, it might be crazy\\n\\nBut it’s the only one I’ve got\\n\\n\\n\\nCome baby, shake me, come baby, take me, I would be satisfied\\n\\nCome baby, hold me, come baby, help me, my arms are open wide\\n\\nI could be unraveling wherever I’m traveling, even to foreign shores\\n\\nBut I will always be emotionally yours\\n\\nTrust yourself\\n\\nTrust yourself to do the things that only you know best\\n\\nTrust yourself\\n\\nTrust yourself to do what’s right and not be second-guessed\\n\\nDon’t trust me to show you beauty\\n\\nWhen beauty may only turn to rust\\n\\nIf you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself\\n\\n\\n\\nTrust yourself\\n\\nTrust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end\\n\\nTrust yourself\\n\\nTrust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when\\n\\nDon’t trust me to show you the truth\\n\\nWhen the truth may only be ashes and dust\\n\\nIf you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, you’re on your own, you always were\\n\\nIn a land of wolves and thieves\\n\\nDon’t put your hope in ungodly man\\n\\nOr be a slave to what somebody else believes\\n\\n\\n\\nTrust yourself\\n\\nAnd you won’t be disappointed when vain people let you down\\n\\nTrust yourself\\n\\nAnd look not for answers where no answers can be found\\n\\nDon’t trust me to show you love\\n\\nWhen my love may be only lust\\n\\nIf you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself\\n\\nEverybody wants to know why he couldn’t adjust\\n\\nAdjust to what, a dream that

one I’ve been looking for\\n\\nYou’re the one that’s got the key\\n\\nBut I can’t figure out whether I’m too good for you\\n\\nOr you’re too good for me\\n\\n\\n\\nHas anybody seen my love\\n\\nHas anybody seen my love\\n\\nHas anybody seen my love\\n\\nI don’t know\\n\\nHas anybody seen my love?\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, they’re not showing any lights tonight\\n\\nAnd there’s no moon\\n\\nThere’s just a

is no more\\n\\nYou cut to the core\\n\\nQuicker than anyone I knew\\n\\nWhen I’m all alone\\n\\nIn the great unknown\\n\\nI’ll remember you\\n\\n\\n\\nI’ll remember you\\n\\nAt the end of the trail\\n\\nI had so much left to do\\n\\nI had so little time to fail\\n\\nThere’s some people that\\n\\nYou don’t forget\\n\\nEven though you’ve only seen ’m one time or two\\n\\nWhen the roses fade\\n\\nAnd I’m in the shade\\n\\nI’ll remember you\\n\\n\\n\\nDidn’t I, didn’t I try to love you?\\n\\nDidn’t I, didn’t I try to care?\\n\\nDidn’t I sleep, didn’t I weep beside you\\n\\nWith the rain blowing in your hair?\\n\\n\\n\\nI’ll remember you\\n\\nWhen the wind blows through the piney wood\\n\\nIt was you who came right through\\n\\nIt was you who understood\\n\\nThough I’d never say\\n\\nThat I done it the way\\n\\nThat you’d have liked me to\\n\\nIn the end\\n\\nMy dear sweet friend\\n\\nI’ll remember you\\n\\n\\nOh, the gentlemen are talking and the midnight moon is on the riverside\\n\\nThey’re drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide\\n\\nI live in another world where life and death are memorized\\n\\nWhere the earth is strung with lovers’ pearls and all I see are dark eyes\\n\\n\\n\\nA cock is crowing far away and another soldier’s deep in prayer\\n\\nSome mother’s child has gone astray, she can’t find him anywhere\\n\\nBut I can hear another drum beating for the dead that rise\\n\\nWhom nature’s beast fears as they come and all I see are dark eyes\\n\\n\\n\\nThey tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes\\n\\nThey tell me revenge is sweet and from where they stand, I’m sure it is\\n\\nBut I feel nothing for their game where beauty goes unrecognized\\n\\nAll I feel is heat and flame and all I see are dark eyes\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, the French girl, she’s in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel\\n\\nHunger pays a heavy price to the falling gods of speed and steel\\n\\nOh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that flies\\n\\nA million faces at my feet but all I see are dark eyes\\n\\n\\nWell, there was this movie I seen one time\\n\\nAbout a man riding ’cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck\\n\\nHe was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself\\n\\nThe townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, the marshal, now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp\\n\\nAs the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath\\n\\n“Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square\\n\\nI want him to feel what it’s like to every moment face his death”\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in\\n\\nAnd you know it blows right through me like a ball and chain\\n\\nYou know I can’t believe we’ve lived so long and are still so far apart\\n\\nThe memory of you keeps callin’ after me like a rollin’ train\\n\\n\\n\\nI can still see the day that you came to me on the painted desert\\n\\nIn your busted down Ford and your platform heels\\n\\nI could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet\\n\\nAh, but you were right. It was perfect as I got in behind the wheel\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, we drove that car all night into San Anton’\\n\\nAnd we slept near the Alamo, your skin was so tender and soft\\n\\nWay down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back\\n\\nI would have gone on after you but I didn’t feel like letting my head get blown off\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, we’re drivin’ this car and the sun is comin’ up over the Rockies\\n\\nNow I know she ain’t you but she’s here and she’s got that dark rhythm in her soul\\n\\nBut I’m too over the edge and I ain’t in the mood anymore to remember the times\\n\\n    when I was your only man\\n\\nAnd she don’t want to remind me. She knows this car would go out of control\\n\\n\\n\\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls\\n\\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above\\n\\nBrownsville girl, show me all around the world\\n\\nBrownsville girl, you’re my honey love\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo\\n\\nWe pulled up where Henry Porter used to live. He owned a wreckin’ lot\\n\\n    outside of town about a mile\\n\\nRuby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back.\\n\\n    She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust\\n\\nShe said, “Henry ain’t here but you can come on in, he’ll be back in a little while”\\n\\n\\n\\nThen she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinkin’ of\\n\\n    bummin’ a ride back to from where she started\\n\\nBut ya know, she changed the subject every time money came up\\n\\nShe said, “Welcome to the land of the living dead”\\n\\n    You could tell she was so broken hearted\\n\\nShe said, “Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt”\\n\\n\\n\\n“How far are y’all going?” Ruby asked us with a sigh\\n\\n“We’re going all the way ’til the wheels fall off and burn\\n\\n’Til the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies”\\n\\nRuby just smiled and said, “Ah, you know some babies never learn”\\n\\n\\n\\nSomething about that movie though, well I just can’t get it out of my head\\n\\nBut I can’t remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play\\n\\nAll I remember about it was Gregory Peck and the way people moved\\n\\nAnd a lot of them seemed to be lookin’ my way\\n\\n\\n\\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,\\n\\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above\\n\\nBrownsville girl, show me all around the world\\n\\nBrownsville girl, you’re my honey love\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour\\n\\nI was crossin’ the street when shots rang out\\n\\nI didn’t know whether to duck or to run, so I ran\\n\\n“We got him cornered in the churchyard,” I heard somebody shout\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune. Underneath it,\\n\\n    it said, “A man with no alibi”\\n\\nYou went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you\\n\\nThen when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears\\n\\nIt was the best acting I saw anybody do\\n\\n\\n\\nNow I’ve always been the kind of person that doesn’t like to trespass\\n\\n    but sometimes you just find yourself over the line\\n\\nOh if there’s an original thought out there, I could use it right now\\n\\nYou know, I feel pretty good, but that ain’t sayin’ much.\\n\\n    I could feel a whole lot better\\n\\nIf you were just here by my side to show me how\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I’m standin’ in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck\\n\\nYeah, but you know it’s not the one that I had in mind\\n\\nHe’s got a new one out now, I don’t even know what it’s about\\n\\nBut I’ll see him in anything so I’ll stand in line\\n\\n\\n\\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls\\n\\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above\\n\\nBrownsville girl, show me all around the world\\n\\nBrownsville girl, you’re my honey love\\n\\n\\n\\nYou know, it’s funny how things never turn out the way you had ’em planned\\n\\nThe only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter\\n\\n    is that his name wasn’t Henry Porter\\n\\nAnd you know there was somethin’ about you baby that I liked\\n\\n    that was always too good for this world\\n\\nJust like you always said there was somethin’ about me you liked\\n\\n    that I left behind in the French Quarter\\n\\n\\n\\nStrange how people who suffer together have stronger connections\\n\\n    than people who are most content\\n\\nI don’t have any regrets, they can talk about me plenty when I’m gone\\n\\nYou always said people don’t do what they believe in,\\n\\n    they just do what’s most convenient, then they repent\\n\\nAnd I always said, “Hang on to me, baby, and let’s hope that the roof stays on”\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a movie I seen one time, I think I sat through it twice\\n\\nI don’t remember who I was or where I was bound\\n\\nAll I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck, he wore a gun\\n\\n    and he was shot in the back\\n\\nSeems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down\\n\\n\\n\\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls\\n\\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above\\n\\nBrownsville girl, show me all around the world\\n\\nBrownsville girl, you’re my honey love\\n\\nI didn’t know that you’d be leavin’\\n\\nOr who you thought you were talkin’ to\\n\\nI figure maybe we’re even\\n\\nOr maybe I’m one up on you\\n\\n\\n\\nI send you all my money\\n\\nJust like I did before\\n\\nI tried to reach you honey\\n\\nBut you’re driftin’ too far from shore\\n\\n\\n\\nDriftin’ too far from shore\\n\\nDriftin’ too far from shore\\n\\nDriftin’ too far from shore\\n\\nDriftin’ too far from shore\\n\\n\\n\\nI ain’t gonna get lost in this current\\n\\nI don’t like playing cat and mouse\\n\\nNo gentleman likes making love to a servant\\n\\nEspecially when he’s in his father’s house\\n\\n\\n\\nI never could guess your weight, baby\\n\\nNever needed to call you my whore\\n\\nI always thought you were straight, baby\\n\\nBut you’re driftin’ too far from shore\\n\\n\\n\\nDriftin’ too far from shore\\n\\nDriftin’ too far from shore\\n\\nDriftin’ too far from shore\\n\\nDriftin’ too far from shore\\n\\n\\n\\nWell these times and these tunnels are haunted\\n\\nThe bottom of the barrel is too\\n\\nI waited years sometimes for what I wanted\\n\\nEverybody can’t be as lucky as you\\n\\n\\n\\nNever no more do I wonder\\n\\nWhy you don’t never play with me anymore\\n\\nAt any moment you could go under\\n\\n’Cause you’re driftin’ too far from shore\\n\\n\\n\\nDriftin’ too far from shore\\n\\nDriftin’ too far from shore\\n\\nDriftin’ too far from shore\\n\\nDriftin’ too far from shore\\n\\n\\n\\nYou and me we had completeness\\n\\nI give you all of what I could

wide open, African trees\\n\\nBent over backwards from a hurricane breeze\\n\\nNot a word of goodbye, not even a note\\n\\nShe gone with the man\\n\\nIn the long black coat\\n\\n\\n\\nSomebody seen him hanging around\\n\\nAt the old dance hall on the outskirts of town\\n\\nHe looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask\\n\\nIf he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask\\n\\nSomebody said from the Bible he’d quote\\n\\nThere was dust on the man\\n\\nIn the long black coat\\n\\n\\n\\nPreacher was a talkin’, there’s a sermon he gave\\n\\nHe said \"Every man’s conscience is vile and depraved\\n\\nYou cannot depend on it to be your guide\\n\\nWhen it’s you who must keep it satisfied.\"\\n\\nIt ain’t easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat\\n\\nShe gave her heart to the man\\n\\nIn the long black coat\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are no mistakes in life some people say\\n\\nAnd it\\'s true sometimes you can see it that way\\n\\nI went down to the river but I just missed the boat\\n\\nShe went with the man\\n\\nIn the long black coat\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s smoke on the water, it’s been there since June\\n\\nTree trunks uprooted, \\'neath the high crescent moon\\n\\nFeel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force\\n\\nSomebody is out there beating a dead horse\\n\\nShe never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote\\n\\nShe went with the man\\n\\nIn the long black coat\\n\\n\\nI was thinking of a series of dreams\\n\\nWhere nothing comes up to the top\\n\\nEverything stays down where it’s wounded\\n\\nAnd comes to a permanent stop\\n\\nWasn’t thinking of anything specific\\n\\nLike in a dream, when someone wakes up and screams\\n\\nNothing too very scientific\\n\\nJust thinking of a series of dreams\\n\\n\\n\\nThinking of a series of dreams\\n\\nWhere the time and the tempo fly\\n\\nAnd there’s no exit in any direction\\n\\n’Cept the one that you can’t see with your eyes\\n\\nWasn’t making any great connection\\n\\nWasn’t falling for any intricate scheme\\n\\nNothing that would pass inspection\\n\\nJust thinking of a series of dreams\\n\\n\\n\\nDreams where the umbrella is folded\\n\\nInto the path you are hurled\\n\\nAnd the cards are no good that you’re holding\\n\\nUnless they’re from another world\\n\\n\\n\\nIn one, numbers were burning\\n\\nIn another, I witnessed a crime\\n\\nIn one, I was running, and in another\\n\\nAll I seemed to be doing was climb\\n\\nWasn’t looking for any special assistance\\n\\nNot going to any great extremes\\n\\nI’d already gone the distance\\n\\nJust thinking of a series of dreams\\n\\nWe live in a political world\\n\\nLove don’t have any place\\n\\nWe’re living in times where men commit crimes\\n\\nAnd crime don’t have a face\\n\\n\\n\\nWe live in a political world\\n\\nIcicles hanging down\\n\\nWedding bells ring and angels sing\\n\\nClouds cover up the ground\\n\\n\\n\\nWe live in a political world\\n\\nWisdom is thrown into jail\\n\\nIt rots in a cell, is misguided as hell\\n\\nLeaving no one to pick up a trail\\n\\n\\n\\nWe live in a political world\\n\\nWhere mercy walks the plank\\n\\nLife is in mirrors, death disappears\\n\\nUp the steps into the nearest bank\\n\\n\\n\\nWe live in a political world\\n\\nWhere courage is a thing of the past\\n\\nHouses are haunted, children are unwanted\\n\\nThe next day could be your last\\n\\n\\n\\nWe live in a political world\\n\\nThe one we can see and can feel\\n\\nBut there’s no one to check, it’s all a stacked deck\\n\\nWe all know for sure that it’s real\\n\\n\\n\\nWe live in a political world\\n\\nIn the cities of lonesome fear\\n\\nLittle by little you turn in the middle\\n\\nBut you’re never sure why you’re here\\n\\n\\n\\nWe live in a political world\\n\\nUnder the microscope\\n\\nYou can travel anywhere and hang yourself there\\n\\nYou always got more than enough rope\\n\\n\\n\\nWe live in a political world\\n\\nTurning and a-thrashing about\\n\\nAs soon as you’re awake, you’re trained to take\\n\\nWhat looks like the easy way out\\n\\n\\n\\nWe live in a political world\\n\\nWhere peace is not welcome at all\\n\\nIt’s turned away from the door to wander some more\\n\\nOr put up against the wall\\n\\n\\n\\nWe live in a political world\\n\\nEverything is hers or his\\n\\nClimb into the frame and shout God’s name\\n\\nBut you’re never sure what it is\\n\\n\\nFar away where the soft winds blow\\n\\nFar away from it all\\n\\nThere is a place you go\\n\\nWhere teardrops fall\\n\\n\\n\\nFar away in the stormy night\\n\\nFar away and over the wall\\n\\nYou are there in the flickering light\\n\\nWhere teardrops fall\\n\\n\\n\\nWe banged the drum slowly\\n\\nAnd played the fife lowly\\n\\nYou know the song in my heart\\n\\nIn the turning of twilight\\n\\nIn the shadows of moonlight\\n\\nYou can show me a new place to start\\n\\n\\n\\nI’ve torn my clothes and I’ve drained the cup\\n\\nStrippin’ away at it all\\n\\nThinking of you when the sun comes up\\n\\nWhere teardrops fall\\n\\n\\n\\nBy rivers of blindness\\n\\nIn love and with kindness\\n\\nWe could hold up a toast if we meet\\n\\nTo the cuttin’ of fences\\n\\nTo sharpen the senses\\n\\nThat linger in the fireball heat\\n\\n\\n\\nRoses are red, violets are blue\\n\\nAnd time is beginning to crawl\\n\\nI just might have to come see you\\n\\nWhere teardrops fall\\n\\nWhat good am I if I’m like all the rest\\n\\nIf I just turn away, when I see how you’re dressed\\n\\nIf I shut myself off so I can’t hear you cry\\n\\nWhat good am I?\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat good am I if I know and don’t do\\n\\nIf I see and don’t say, if I look right through you\\n\\nIf I turn a deaf ear to the thunderin’ sky\\n\\nWhat good am I?\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat good am I while you softly weep\\n\\nAnd I hear in my head what you say in your sleep\\n\\nAnd I freeze in the moment like the rest who don’t try\\n\\nWhat good am I?\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat good am I then to others and me\\n\\nIf I’ve had every chance and yet still fail to see\\n\\nIf my hands are tied must I not wonder within\\n\\nWho tied them and why and where must I have been?\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat good am I if I say foolish things\\n\\nAnd I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings\\n\\nAnd I just turn my back while you silently die\\n\\nWhat good am I?\\n\\n\\nMost of the time\\n\\nI’m clear focused all around\\n\\nMost of the time\\n\\nI can keep both feet on the ground\\n\\nI can follow the path, I can read the signs\\n\\nStay right with it when the road unwinds\\n\\nI can handle whatever I stumble upon\\n\\nI don’t even notice she’s gone\\n\\nMost of the time\\n\\n\\n\\nMost of the time\\n\\nIt’s well understood\\n\\nMost of the time\\n\\nI wouldn’t change it if I could\\n\\nI can make it all match up, I can hold my own\\n\\nI can deal with the situation right down to the bone\\n\\nI can survive, I can endure\\n\\nAnd I don’t even think about her\\n\\nMost of the time\\n\\n\\n\\nMost of the time\\n\\nMy head is on straight\\n\\nMost of the time\\n\\nI’m strong enough not to hate\\n\\nI don’t build up illusion ’til it makes me sick\\n\\nI ain’t afraid of confusion no matter how thick\\n\\nI can smile in the face of mankind\\n\\nDon’t even remember what her lips felt like on mine\\n\\nMost of the time\\n\\n\\n\\nMost of the time\\n\\nShe ain’t even in my mind\\n\\nI wouldn’t know her if I saw her\\n\\nShe’s that far behind\\n\\nMost of the time\\n\\nI can’t even be sure\\n\\nIf she was ever with me\\n\\nOr if I was with her\\n\\n\\n\\nMost of the time\\n\\nI’m halfway content\\n\\nMost of the time\\n\\nI know exactly where it went\\n\\nI don’t cheat on myself, I don’t run and hide\\n\\nHide from the feelings that are buried inside\\n\\nI don’t compromise and I don’t pretend\\n\\nI don’t even care if I ever see her again\\n\\nMost of the time\\n\\nBroken lines, broken strings\\n\\nBroken threads, broken springs\\n\\nBroken idols, broken heads\\n\\nPeople sleeping in broken beds\\n\\nAin’t no use jiving, ain’t no use joking\\n\\nEverything is broken\\n\\n\\n\\nBroken bottles, broken plates\\n\\nBroken switches, broken gates\\n\\nBroken dishes, broken parts\\n\\nStreets are filled with broken hearts\\n\\nBroken words never meant to be spoken\\n\\nEverything is broken\\n\\n\\n\\nSeem like every time you stop and turn around\\n\\nSomething else just hit the ground\\n\\n\\n\\nBroken cutters, broken saws\\n\\nBroken buckles, broken laws\\n\\nBroken bodies, broken bones\\n\\nBroken voices on broken phones\\n\\nTake a deep breath, feel like you’re chokin\\'\\n\\nEverything is broken\\n\\n\\n\\nEvery time you leave and go off someplace\\n\\nThings fall to pieces in my face\\n\\n\\n\\nBroken hands on broken ploughs\\n\\nBroken treaties, broken vows\\n\\nBroken pipes, broken tools\\n\\nPeople bending broken rules\\n\\nHound dog howling, bullfrog croaking\\n\\nEverything is broken\\n\\n\\nWhat was it you wanted?\\n\\nTell me again so I’ll know\\n\\nWhat’s happening in there\\n\\nWhat’s going on in your show\\n\\nWhat was it you wanted\\n\\nCould you say it again?\\n\\nI’ll be back in a minute\\n\\nYou can get it together by then\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat was it you wanted\\n\\nYou can tell me, I’m back\\n\\nWe can start it all over\\n\\nGet it back on the track\\n\\nYou got my attention\\n\\nGo ahead, speak\\n\\nWhat was it you wanted\\n\\nWhen you were kissing my cheek?\\n\\n\\n\\nWas there somebody looking\\n\\nWhen you give me that kiss\\n\\nSomeone there in the shadows\\n\\nSomeone that I might have missed?\\n\\nIs there something you needed\\n\\nSomething I don’t understand\\n\\nWhat was it you wanted\\n\\nDo I have it here in my hand?\\n\\n\\n\\nWhatever you wanted\\n\\nSlipped out of my mind\\n\\nWould you remind me again\\n\\nIf you’d be so kind\\n\\nHas the record been breaking\\n\\nDid the needle just skip\\n\\nIs there somebody waiting\\n\\nWas there a slip of the lip?\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat was it you wanted\\n\\nI ain’t keeping score\\n\\nAre you the same person\\n\\nThat was here before?\\n\\nIs it something important?\\n\\nMaybe not\\n\\nWhat was it you wanted?\\n\\nTell me again I forgot\\n\\n\\n\\nWhatever you wanted\\n\\nWhat could it be\\n\\nDid somebody tell you\\n\\nThat you could get it from me\\n\\nIs it something that comes natural\\n\\nIs it easy to say\\n\\nWhy do you want it\\n\\nWho are you anyway?\\n\\n\\n\\nIs the scenery changing\\n\\nAm I getting it wrong\\n\\nIs the whole thing going backwards\\n\\nAre they playing our song?\\n\\nWhere were you when it started\\n\\nDo you want it for free\\n\\nWhat was it you wanted\\n\\nAre you talking to me?\\n\\nSeen a shooting star tonight\\n\\nAnd I thought of you\\n\\nYou were trying to break into another world\\n\\nA world I never knew\\n\\nI always kind of wondered\\n\\nIf you ever made it through\\n\\nSeen a shooting star tonight\\n\\nAnd I thought of you\\n\\n\\n\\nSeen a shooting star tonight\\n\\nAnd I thought of me\\n\\nIf I was still the same\\n\\nIf I ever became what you wanted me to be\\n\\nDid I miss the mark or overstep the line\\n\\nThat only you could see?\\n\\nSeen a shooting star tonight\\n\\nAnd I thought of me\\n\\n\\n\\nListen to the engine, listen to the bell\\n\\nAs the last fire truck from hell\\n\\nGoes rolling by\\n\\nAll good people are praying\\n\\nIt’s the last temptation, the last account\\n\\nThe last time you might hear the sermon on the mount\\n\\nThe last radio is playing\\n\\n\\n\\nSeen a shooting star tonight\\n\\nSlip away\\n\\nTomorrow will be\\n\\nAnother day\\n\\nGuess it’s too late to say the things to you\\n\\nThat you needed to hear me say\\n\\nSeen a shooting star tonight\\n\\nSlip away\\n\\n\\nOne time in London I’d gone out for a walk\\n\\nPast a place called Hyde Park where people talk\\n\\n’Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view\\n\\nTo anyone passing by, that’s who they’re talking to\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was someone on a platform talking to the folks\\n\\nAbout the T.V. god and all the pain that it invokes\\n\\n“It’s too bright a light,” he said, “for anybody’s eyes\\n\\nIf you’ve never seen one it’s a blessing in disguise”\\n\\n\\n\\nI moved in closer, got up on my toes\\n\\nTwo men in front of me were coming to blows\\n\\nThe man was saying something ’bout children when they’re young\\n\\nBeing sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung\\n\\n\\n\\n“The news of the day is on all the time\\n\\nAll the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme\\n\\nYour mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free\\n\\nDon’t let an egg get laid in it by something you can’t see”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Pray for peace!” he said.

seems\\n\\nWoke up this morning and I looked at the same old page\\n\\nSame ol’ rat race\\n\\nLife in the same ol’ cage\\n\\n\\n\\nI don’t want nothing from anyone, ain’t that much to take\\n\\nWouldn’t know the difference between a real blonde and a fake\\n\\nFeel like a prisoner in a world of mystery\\n\\nI wish someone would come\\n\\nAnd push back the clock for me\\n\\n\\n\\nWell my heart’s in the Highlands wherever I roam\\n\\nThat’s where I’ll be when I get called home\\n\\nThe wind, it whispers to the buckeyed trees in rhyme\\n\\nWell my heart’s in the Highlands\\n\\nI can only get there one step at a time\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound\\n\\nSomeone’s always yelling turn it down\\n\\nFeel like I’m drifting\\n\\nDrifting from scene to scene\\n\\nI’m wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean?\\n\\n\\n\\nInsanity is smashing up against my soul\\n\\nYou can say I was on anything but a roll\\n\\nIf I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top\\n\\nWhat would I do with it anyway\\n\\nMaybe take it to the pawn shop\\n\\n\\n\\nMy heart’s in the Highlands at the break of dawn\\n\\nBy the beautiful lake of the Black Swan\\n\\nBig white clouds like chariots that swing down low\\n\\nWell my heart’s in the Highlands\\n\\nOnly place left to go\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m in Boston town, in some restaurant\\n\\nI got no idea what I want\\n\\nWell, maybe I do but I’m just really not sure\\n\\nWaitress comes over\\n\\nNobody in the place but me and her\\n\\n\\n\\nIt must be a holiday, there’s nobody around\\n\\nShe studies me closely as I sit down\\n\\nShe got a pretty face and long white shiny legs\\n\\nShe says, “What’ll it be?”\\n\\nI say, “I don’t know, you got any soft boiled eggs?”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe looks at me, says, “I’d bring you some\\n\\nBut we’re out of ’m, you picked the wrong time to come”\\n\\nThen she says, “I know you’re an artist, draw a picture of me!”\\n\\nI say, “I would if I could, but\\n\\nI don’t do sketches from memory”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well,” she says, “I’m right here in front of you, or haven’t you looked?”\\n\\nI say, “All right, I know, but I don’t have my drawing book!”\\n\\nShe gives me a napkin, she says, “You can do it on that”\\n\\nI say, “Yes I could, but\\n\\nI don’t know where my pencil is at!”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe pulls one out from behind her ear\\n\\nShe says, “All right now, go ahead, draw me, I’m standing right here”\\n\\nI make a few lines and I show it for her to see\\n\\nWell she takes the napkin and throws it back\\n\\nAnd says, “That don’t look a thing like me!”\\n\\n\\n\\nI said, “Oh, kind Miss, it most certainly does”\\n\\nShe says, “You must be jokin’.” I say, “I wish I was!”\\n\\nThen she says, “You don’t read women authors, do you?”\\n\\nLeast that’s what I think I hear her say\\n\\n“Well,” I say, “how would you know and what would it matter anyway?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well,” she says, “you just don’t seem like you do!”\\n\\nI said, “You’re way wrong”\\n\\nShe says, “Which ones have you read then?” I say, “I read Erica Jong!”\\n\\nShe goes away for a minute\\n\\nAnd I slide up out of my chair\\n\\nI step outside back to the busy street but nobody’s going anywhere\\n\\n\\n\\nWell my heart’s in the Highlands with the horses and hounds\\n\\nWay up in the border country, far from the towns\\n\\nWith the twang of the arrow and a snap of the bow\\n\\nMy heart’s in the Highlands\\n\\nCan’t see any other way to go\\n\\n\\n\\nEvery day is the same thing out the door\\n\\nFeel further away then ever before\\n\\nSome things in life, it gets too late to learn\\n\\nWell, I’m lost somewhere\\n\\nI must have made a few bad turns\\n\\n\\n\\nI see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes\\n\\nThey’re drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes\\n\\nAll the young men with their young women looking so good\\n\\nWell, I’d trade places with any of them\\n\\nIn a minute, if I could\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog\\n\\nTalking to myself in a monologue\\n\\nI think what I need might be a full-length leather coat\\n\\nSomebody just asked me\\n\\nIf I registered to vote\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sun is beginning to shine on me\\n\\nBut it’s not like the sun that used to be\\n\\nThe party’s over and there’s less and less to say\\n\\nI got new eyes\\n\\nEverything looks far away\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, my heart’s in the Highlands at the break of day\\n\\nOver the hills and far away\\n\\nThere’s a way to get there and I’ll figure it out somehow\\n\\nBut I’m already there in my mind\\n\\nAnd that’s good enough for now\\n\\nI’m walking through streets that are dead\\n\\nWalking, walking with you in my head\\n\\nMy feet are so tired, my brain is so wired\\n\\nAnd the clouds are weeping\\n\\n\\n\\nDid I hear someone tell a lie?\\n\\nDid I hear someone’s distant cry?\\n\\nYou thrilled me to my heart, then you ripped it all apart\\n\\nYou went through my pockets when I was sleeping\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m sick of love…but I’m in the thick of it\\n\\nThis kind of love…I’m so sick of it\\n\\n\\n\\nI see lovers in the meadow\\n\\nI see silhouettes in the window\\n\\nI watch them ’til they’re gone and they leave me hanging on\\n\\nTo a shadow\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m sick of love…I hear the clock tick\\n\\nThis kind of love…I’m love sick\\n\\n\\n\\nSometimes the silence can be like the thunder\\n\\nSometimes I feel like I’m being plowed under\\n\\nCould you ever be true? I think of you\\n\\nAnd I wonder\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m sick of love…I wish I’d never met you\\n\\nI’m sick of love…I’m trying to forget you\\n\\n\\n\\nJust don’t know what to do\\n\\nI’d give anything to be with you\\n\\nGon’ walk down that dirt road, ’til someone lets me ride\\n\\nGon’ walk down that dirt road, ’til someone lets me ride\\n\\nIf I can’t find my baby, I’m gonna run away and hide\\n\\n\\n\\nI been pacing around the room hoping maybe she’d come back\\n\\nPacing ’round the room hoping maybe she’d come back\\n\\nWell, I been praying for salvation laying ’round in a one-room country shack\\n\\n\\n\\nGon’ walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed\\n\\nGon’ walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed\\n\\n’Til there’s nothing left to see, ’til the chains have been shattered and I’ve been freed\\n\\n\\n\\nI been lookin’ at my shadow, I been watching the colors up above\\n\\nLookin’ at my shadow, watching the colors up above\\n\\nRolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love\\n\\n\\n\\nGon’ walk on down that dirt road ’til I’m right beside the sun\\n\\nGon’ walk on down until I’m right beside the sun\\n\\nI’m gonna have to put up a barrier to keep myself away from everyone\\n\\nI’m beginning to hear voices and there’s no one around\\n\\nWell, I’m all used up and the fields have turned brown\\n\\nI went to church on Sunday and she passed by\\n\\nMy love for her is taking such a long time to die\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m waist deep, waist deep in the mist\\n\\nIt’s almost like, almost like I don’t exist\\n\\nI’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound\\n\\n\\n\\nThe walls of pride are high and wide\\n\\nCan’t see over to the other side\\n\\nIt’s such a sad thing to see beauty decay\\n\\nIt’s sadder still to feel your heart torn away\\n\\n\\n\\nOne look at you and I’m out of control\\n\\nLike the universe has swallowed me whole\\n\\nI’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s too many people, too many to recall\\n\\nI thought some of ’m were friends of mine, I was wrong about ’m all\\n\\nWell, the road is rocky and the hillside’s mud\\n\\nUp over my head nothing but clouds of blood\\n\\n\\n\\nI found my world, found my world in you\\n\\nBut your love just hasn’t proved true\\n\\nI’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound\\n\\nTwenty miles out of town in cold irons bound\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds\\n\\nReality has always had too many heads\\n\\nSome things last longer than you think they will\\n\\nThere are some kind of things you can never kill\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s you and you only I been thinking about\\n\\nBut you can’t see in and it’s hard lookin’ out\\n\\nI’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound\\n\\n\\n\\nWell the fat’s in the fire and the water’s in the tank\\n\\nThe whiskey’s in the jar and the money’s in the bank\\n\\nI tried to love and protect you because I cared\\n\\nI’m gonna remember forever the joy that we shared\\n\\n\\n\\nLooking at you and I’m on my bended knee\\n\\nYou have no idea what you do to me\\n\\nI’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound\\n\\nTwenty miles out of town in cold irons bound\\n\\n\\nThe seasons they are turnin’\\n\\nAnd my sad heart is yearnin’\\n\\nTo hear again the songbird’s sweet melodious tone\\n\\nMeet me in the moonlight alone\\n\\n\\n\\nThe dusky light, the day is losing\\n\\nOrchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan\\n\\nThe earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone\\n\\nMeet me in the moonlight alone\\n\\n\\n\\nThe air is thick and heavy\\n\\nAll along the levee\\n\\nWhere the geese into the countryside have flown\\n\\nMeet me in the moonlight alone\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I’m preachin’ peace and harmony\\n\\nThe blessings of tranquility\\n\\nFloating like a dream across the floor\\n\\nI’ll take you ’cross the river dear\\n\\nYou’ve no need to linger here\\n\\nDraw the blinds, step outside the door\\n\\n\\n\\nThe clouds are turnin’ crimson\\n\\nThe leaves fall from the limbs an’\\n\\nThe branches cast their shadows over stone\\n\\nMeet me in the moonlight alone\\n\\n\\n\\nThe boulevards of Cypress trees\\n\\nThe masquerades of birds and bees\\n\\nThe petals, pink and white, the wind has blown\\n\\nMeet me in the moonlight alone\\n\\n\\n\\nThe trailing moss and mystic glow\\n\\nPurple blossoms soft as snow\\n\\nStep up and drop the coin right into the slot\\n\\nThe fading light of sunset glowed\\n\\nIt’s crowded on the narrow road\\n\\nWho cares whether you forgive me or not\\n\\n\\n\\nMy pulse is runnin’ through my palm\\n\\nThe sharp hills are rising from\\n\\nThe yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan\\n\\nMeet me in the moonlight alone\\n\\n\\nBye and bye, I’m breathin’ a lover’s sigh\\n\\nI’m sittin’ on my watch so I can be on time\\n\\nI’m singin’ love’s praises with sugar-coated rhyme\\n\\nBye and bye, on you I’m casting my eye\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m paintin’ the town—swinging my partner around\\n\\nI know who I can depend on, I know who to trust\\n\\nI’m watchin’ the roads, I’m studying the dust\\n\\nI’m paintin’ the town making my last go-round\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I’m slippin’ and slidin’, walkin’ on briars\\n\\nTo get to the one that my heart desires\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m rollin’ slow—I’m doing all I know\\n\\nI’m tellin’ myself I found true happiness\\n\\nThat I’ve still got a dream that hasn’t been repossessed\\n\\nI’m rollin’ slow, goin’ where the wild red roses grow\\n\\n\\n\\nWell the future for me is already a thing of the past\\n\\nYou were my first love and you will be my last\\n\\n\\n\\nPapa gone mad, mama, she’s feeling sad\\n\\nI’ll establish my rule through civil war\\n\\nBring it on up from the ocean’s floor\\n\\nI’ll take you higher just so you can see the

away\\n\\n\\n\\nI woke up this morning and sprang to my feet\\n\\nWent into town on a whim\\n\\nI saw my father there in the street\\n\\nAt least I think it was him\\n\\nIn the dark I hear the night birds call\\n\\nThe hills are rugged and steep\\n\\nI sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall\\n\\nIf I told you my whole story you’d weep\\n\\n\\n\\nMeet me at the bottom, don’t lag behind\\n\\nBring me my boots and shoes\\n\\nYou can hang back or fight your best on the front line\\n\\nSing a little bit of these workingman’s blues\\n\\n\\n\\nThey burned my barn and they stole my horse\\n\\nI can’t save a dime\\n\\nIt’s a long way down and I don’t want to be forced\\n\\nInto a life of continual crime\\n\\nI can see for myself that the sun is sinking\\n\\nO’er the banks of the deep blue sea\\n\\nTell me, am I wrong in thinking\\n\\nThat you have forgotten me\\n\\n\\n\\nNow they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret\\n\\nThey waste your nights and days\\n\\nThem, I will forget\\n\\nYou, I’ll remember always\\n\\nIt’s a cold black night and it’s midsummer’s eve\\n\\nAnd the stars are spinning around\\n\\nI still find it so hard to believe\\n\\nThat someone would kick me when I’m down\\n\\n\\n\\nMeet me at the bottom, don’t lag behind\\n\\nBring me my boots and shoes\\n\\nYou can hang back or fight your best on the front line\\n\\nSing a little bit of these workingman’s blues\\n\\n\\n\\nI’ll be back home in a month or two\\n\\nWhen the frost is on the vine\\n\\nI’ll punch my spear right straight through\\n\\nHalf-ways down your spine\\n\\nI’ll lift up my arms to the starry skies\\n\\nAnd pray the fugitive’s prayer\\n\\nI’m guessing tomorrow the sun will rise\\n\\nI hope the final judgment’s fair\\n\\n\\n\\nThe battle is over up in the hills\\n\\nAnd the mist is closing in\\n\\nLook at me, with all of my spoils\\n\\nWhat did I ever win?\\n\\nGotta brand new suit and a brand new wife\\n\\nI can live on rice and beans\\n\\nSome people never worked a day in their life\\n\\nThey don’t know what work even means\\n\\n\\n\\nMeet me at the bottom, don’t lag behind\\n\\nBring me my boots and shoes\\n\\nYou can hang back or fight your best on the front line Sing a little bit of these workingman’s blues\\n\\nBeyond the horizon, behind the sun\\n\\nAt the end of the rainbow life has only begun\\n\\nIn the long hours of twilight ’neath the stardust above\\n\\nBeyond the horizon it is easy to love\\n\\nI’m staring out the window\\n\\nOf an ancient town\\n\\nPetals from flowers\\n\\nFalling to the ground\\n\\nBeyond the horizon, in the springtime or fall\\n\\nLove waits forever, for one and for all\\n\\n\\n\\nBeyond the horizon, across the divide\\n\\n’Round about midnight, we’ll be on the same side\\n\\nDown in the valley the water runs cold\\n\\nBeyond the horizon someone’s prayin’ for your soul\\n\\nI lost my true lover\\n\\nIn the dusk, in the dawn\\n\\nI have to recover\\n\\nGet up and go on\\n\\nBeyond the horizon, beyond love’s burning game\\n\\nEvery step that you take, I’m walking the same\\n\\n\\n\\nBeyond the horizon, the night winds blow\\n\\nThe theme of a melody from many moons ago\\n\\nThe bells of St. Mary, how sweetly they chime\\n\\nBeyond the horizon I found you just in time\\n\\nSlipping and sliding\\n\\nToo late to stop\\n\\nRiding and gliding\\n\\nIt’s lonely at the top\\n\\nBeyond the horizon, the sky is so blue\\n\\nI’ve got more than a lifetime to live lovin’ you\\n\\n\\nLost John sittin\\' on a railroad track\\n\\nSomething\\'s out of wack\\n\\nBlues this morning falling down like hail\\n\\nGonna leave a greasy trail\\n\\n\\n\\nGonna travel the world is what I\\'m gonna do\\n\\nThen come back and see you\\n\\nAll I ever do is struggle and strive\\n\\nIf I don\\'t do anybody any harm, I might make it back home alive\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'m the oldest son of a crazy man\\n\\nI\\'m in a cowboy band\\n\\nGot a pile of sins to pay for and I ain\\'t got time to hide\\n\\nI\\'d walk through a blazing fire, baby, if I knew you was on the other side\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, I miss you Nettie Moore\\n\\nAnd my happiness is o\\'er\\n\\nWinter\\'s gone, the river\\'s on the rise\\n\\nI loved you then and ever shall\\n\\nBut there\\'s no one here that\\'s left to tell\\n\\nThe world has gone black before my eyes\\n\\n\\n\\nThe world of research has gone berserk\\n\\nToo much paperwork\\n\\nAlbert\\'s in the graveyard, Frankie\\'s raising hell\\n\\nI\\'m beginning to believe what the scriptures tell\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'m going where the Southern crosses the Yellow Dog\\n\\nGet away from all these demagogues\\n\\nAnd these bad luck women stick like glue\\n\\nIt\\'s either one or the other or neither of the two\\n\\n\\n\\nShe says, \"Look out daddy, don\\'t want you to tear your pants.\\n\\nYou can get wrecked in this dance.\"\\n\\nThey say whiskey will kill ya, but I don\\'t think it will\\n\\nI\\'m riding with you to the top of the hill\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, I miss you Nettie Moore\\n\\nAnd my happiness is o\\'er\\n\\nWinter\\'s gone, the river\\'s on the rise\\n\\nI loved you then and ever shall\\n\\nBut there\\'s no one here that\\'s left to tell\\n\\nThe world has gone black before my eyes\\n\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t know why my baby never looked so good before\\n\\nI don\\'t have to wonder no more\\n\\nShe been cooking all day and it\\'s gonna take me all night\\n\\nI can\\'t eat all that stuff in a single bite\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Judge is coming in, everybody rise\\n\\nLift up your eyes\\n\\nYou can do what you please, you don\\'t need my advice\\n\\nBefore you call me any dirty names you better think twice\\n\\n\\n\\nGetting light outside, the temperature dropped\\n\\nI think the rain has stopped\\n\\nI\\'m going to make you come to grips with fate\\n\\nWhen I\\'m through with you, you\\'ll learn to keep your business straight\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, I miss you Nettie Moore\\n\\nAnd my happiness is o\\'er\\n\\nWinter\\'s gone, the river\\'s on the rise\\n\\nI loved you then and ever shall\\n\\nBut there\\'s no one here that\\'s left to tell\\n\\nThe world has gone black before my eyes\\n\\n\\n\\nThe bright spark of the steady lights\\n\\nHas dimmed my sights\\n\\nWhen you\\'re around all my grief gives \\'way\\n\\nA lifetime with you is like some heavenly day\\n\\n\\n\\nEverything I\\'ve ever known to be right has proven wrong\\n\\nI\\'ll be drifting along\\n\\nThe woman I\\'m lovin\\', she rules my heart\\n\\nNo knife could ever cut our love apart\\n\\n\\n\\nToday I\\'ll stand in faith and raise\\n\\nThe voice of praise\\n\\nThe sun is strong, I\\'m standing in the light\\n\\nI wish to God that it were night\\n\\n\\n\\nOh, I miss you Nettie Moore\\n\\nAnd my happiness is o\\'er\\n\\nWinter\\'s gone, the river\\'s on the rise\\n\\nI

it\\n\\nShadows dance upon the wall\\n\\nShadows that seem to know it all\\n\\n\\n\\nAm I too blind to see?\\n\\nIs my heart playing tricks on me?\\n\\nToo late to stop now even though all my friends are gone\\n\\nAll I have and all I know\\n\\nIs this dream of you\\n\\nWhich keeps me living on\\n\\n\\n\\nEverything I touch seems to disappear\\n\\nEverywhere I turn you are always here\\n\\nI\\'ll run this race until my earthly death\\n\\nI\\'ll defend this place with my dying breath\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom a cheerless room in a curtained gloom\\n\\nI saw a star from heaven fall\\n\\nI turned and looked again but it was gone\\n\\nAll I have and all I know\\n\\nIs this dream of you\\n\\nWhich keeps me living on\\n\\n\\nWell I didn’t come here to deal with a doggone thing\\n\\nI just came here to hear the drummer’s cymbal ring\\n\\nThere ain’t no way you can put me down\\n\\nI just want to say that Hell’s my wife’s home town\\n\\n\\n\\nWell there’s reasons for that and reasons for this\\n\\nI can’t think of any just now, but I know they exist\\n\\nI’m sitting in the sun ‘til my skin turns brown\\n\\nI just want to say that Hell’s my wife’s home town\\n\\nHome town, home town\\n\\n\\n\\nShe can make you steal, make you rob\\n\\nGive you the hives, make you lose your job\\n\\nMake things bad, she can make things worse\\n\\nShe got stuff more potent than a gypsy curse\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of these days, I’ll end up on the run\\n\\nI’m pretty sure she’ll make me kill someone\\n\\nI’m going inside, roll the shutters down\\n\\nI just want to say that Hell’s my wife’s home town\\n\\n\\n\\nWell there’s plenty to remember, plenty to forget\\n\\nI still can remember the day we met\\n\\nI lost my reason long ago\\n\\nMy love for her is all I know\\n\\n\\n\\nState gone

to my prayer\\n\\n\\n\\nForgetful heart\\n\\nWe loved with all the love that life can give\\n\\nWhat can I say\\n\\nWithout you it\\'s so hard to live\\n\\nCan\\'t take much more\\n\\nWhy can\\'t we love like we did before\\n\\n\\n\\nForgetful heart\\n\\nLike a walking shadow in my brain\\n\\nAll night long\\n\\nI lay awake and listen to the sound of pain\\n\\nThe door has closed

glass\\n\\nWe\\'ll keep on lovin\\' pretty baby\\n\\nFor as long as love will last\\n\\nBeyond here lies nothin\\'\\n\\nBut the mountains of the past\\n\\n\\n\\nMy ship is in the harbor\\n\\nAnd the sails are spread\\n\\nListen to me pretty baby\\n\\nLay your hand upon my head\\n\\nBeyond here lies nothin\\'\\n\\nNothin\\' done and nothin\\' said\\n\\nWell I’m looking the world over\\n\\nLooking

down to me someday\\n\\n\\nIt was late last night when the boss came home\\n\\nTo a deserted mansion and a desolate throne\\n\\nServant said, “Boss, the lady’s gone\\n\\nShe left this morning just ‘fore dawn.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You got something to tell me, tell it to me, man.\\n\\nCome to the point as straight as you can.”\\n\\n“Old Henry Lee, chief of the clan,\\n\\nCame riding through the woods and took her by the hand.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe boss he laid back flat on his bed\\n\\nHe cursed the heat and he clutched his head\\n\\nHe pondered the future of his fate\\n\\nTo wait another day would be far too late\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Go fetch me my coat and my tie\\n\\nAnd the cheapest labor that money can buy\\n\\nSaddle me up my buckskin mare\\n\\nIf you see me go by, put up a prayer.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, they rode all night and they rode all day\\n\\nEastward long on the broad highway\\n\\nHis spirit was tired and his vision was bent\\n\\nHis men deserted him and onward he went\\n\\n\\n\\nHe came to a place where the light was dull\\n\\nHis forehead pounding in his skull\\n\\nHeavy heart was wracked with pain\\n\\nInsomnia raging in his brain\\n\\n\\n\\nWell he threw down his helmet and his cross-handled sword\\n\\nHe renounced his faith, he denied his Lord\\n\\nCrawled on his belly, put his ear to the wall\\n\\nOne way or another he\\'d put an end to it all\\n\\n\\n\\nHe leaned down, cut the electric wire\\n\\nStared into the flames and he snorted the fire\\n\\nPeered through the darkness, caught a glimpse of the two\\n\\nIt was hard to tell for certain who was who\\n\\n\\n\\nHe lowered himself down on a golden chain\\n\\nHis nerves were quaking in every vein\\n\\nHis knuckles were bloody, he sucked in the air\\n\\nHe ran his fingers through his greasy hair\\n\\n\\n\\nThey looked at each other and their glasses clinked\\n\\nOne single unit inseparably linked\\n\\n“Got a strange premonition there’s a man close by.”\\n\\n“Don’t worry about him, he wouldn’t harm a fly.”\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom behind the curtain the boss crossed the floor\\n\\nHe moved his feet and he bolted the door\\n\\nShadows hiding the lines in his face\\n\\nWith all the nobility of an ancient race\\n\\n\\n\\nShe turned, she was startled with a look of surprise\\n\\nWith a hatred that could hit the skies\\n\\n“You’re a reckless fool, I can see it in your eyes.\\n\\nTo come this way was by no means wise.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Get up, stand up, you greedy lipped wench\\n\\nAnd cover your face or suffer the consequence.\\n\\nYou are making my heart full sick.\\n\\nPut your clothes back on double quick.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Silly boy, you think me a saint.\\n\\nI’ll listen no more to your words of complaint.\\n\\nYou’ve given me nothing but the sweetest lies.\\n\\nNow hold your tongue and feed your eyes.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’d have given you the stars and the planets too\\n\\nBut what good would these things do you?\\n\\nBow the heart, if not the knee\\n\\nOr never again this world you’ll see.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, please let not your heart be cold.\\n\\nThis man is dearer to me than gold.”\\n\\n“Oh my dear, you must be blind.\\n\\nHe’s a gutless ape with a worthless mind.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You had your way too long with me.\\n\\nNow it’s me who’ll determine how things shall be.\\n\\nTry to escape,” he cussed and cursed\\n\\n“You’ll have to try to get past me first.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I dare not let your passion rule.\\n\\nYou think my heart, the heart of a fool.\\n\\nAnd you sir, you cannot deny\\n\\nYou made a monkey of me, what and for why?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’ll have no more of this insulting chat.\\n\\nThe devil can have you, I’ll see to that.\\n\\nLook sharp or step aside,\\n\\nOr in the cradle you’ll wish you died.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe gun went boom and the shot rang clear\\n\\nFirst bullet grazed his ear\\n\\nSecond ball went right straight in\\n\\nAnd he bent in the middle like a twisted pin\\n\\n\\n\\nHe crawled to the corner and he lowered his head\\n\\nHe gripped the chair and he grabbed the bed\\n\\nIt would take more than needle and thread\\n\\nBleeding from the mouth, he’s as good as dead\\n\\n\\n\\n“You shot my husband down, you fiend.”\\n\\n“Husband, what husband, what the hell do you mean?\\n\\nHe was a man of strife, a man of sin.\\n\\nI cut him down and I’ll throw him to the wind.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Hear this,” she said, with angry breath\\n\\n“You too shall meet the lord of death.\\n\\nIt was I who brought your soul to life.”\\n\\nAnd she raised her robe and she drew out a knife\\n\\n\\n\\nHis face was hard and caked with sweat\\n\\nHis arms ached and his hands were wet\\n\\n“You’re a murderous queen and a bloody wife.\\n\\nIf you don’t mind, I’ll have the knife.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“We’re two of a kind and our blood runs hot.\\n\\nBut we’re no way similar in body and thought.\\n\\nAll husbands are good men, as all wives know.”\\n\\nThen she pierced him to the heart and his blood did flow\\n\\n\\n\\nHis knees went limp and he reached for the door\\n\\nHis doom was sealed, he slid to the floor\\n\\nHe whispered in her ear, “This is all your fault.\\n\\nMy fighting days have come to a halt.”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe touched his lip and kissed his cheek\\n\\nHe tried to speak, but his breath was weak\\n\\n“You died for me, now I\\'ll die for you.”\\n\\nShe put the blade to her heart and she ran it through\\n\\n\\n\\nAll three lovers together in a heap\\n\\nThrown into the grave forever to sleep\\n\\nFuneral torches blazed away\\n\\nThrough the towns and the villages all night and all day\\n\\nThe pale moon rose in its glory\\n\\nOut on the western town\\n\\nShe told a sad, sad story\\n\\nOf the great ship that went down\\n\\n\\n\\n‘Twas the fourteen day of April\\n\\nOver the waves she rode\\n\\nSailing into tomorrow\\n\\nTo a golden age foretold\\n\\n\\n\\nThe night was bright with starlight\\n\\nThe seas were sharp and clear\\n\\nMoving through the shadows\\n\\nThe promised hour was near\\n\\n\\n\\nLights were holding steady\\n\\nGliding over the foam\\n\\nAll the lords and ladies\\n\\nHeading for their eternal home\\n\\n\\n\\nThe chandeliers were swaying\\n\\nFrom the balustrades above\\n\\nThe orchestra was playing\\n\\nSongs of faded love\\n\\n\\n\\nThe watchman he lay dreaming\\n\\nAs the ballroom dancers twirled\\n\\nHe dreamed the Titanic was sinking\\n\\nInto the underworld\\n\\n\\n\\nLeo took his sketchbook\\n\\nHe was often so inclined\\n\\nHe closed his eyes and painted\\n\\nThe scenery in his mind\\n\\n\\n\\nCupid struck his bosom\\n\\nAnd broke it with a snap\\n\\nThe closest woman to him\\n\\nHe fell into her lap\\n\\n\\n\\nHe heard a loud commotion\\n\\nSomething sounded wrong\\n\\nHis inner spirit was saying\\n\\nThat he couldn’t stand here long\\n\\n\\n\\nHe staggered to the quarterdeck\\n\\nNo time now to sleep\\n\\nWater on the quarterdeck\\n\\nAlready three foot deep\\n\\n\\n\\nSmokestack leaning sideways\\n\\nHeavy feet began to pound\\n\\nHe walked into the whirlwind\\n\\nSky spinning all around\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ship was going under\\n\\nThe universe opened wide\\n\\nThe roll was called up yonder\\n\\nThe angels turned aside\\n\\n\\n\\nLights down in the hallway\\n\\nFlickering dim and dull\\n\\nDead bodies already floating\\n\\nIn the double bottomed hull\\n\\n\\n\\nThe engines then exploded\\n\\nPropellers they failed to start\\n\\nThe boilers overloaded\\n\\nThe ship\\'s bow split apart\\n\\n\\n\\nPassengers were flying\\n\\nBackward, forward, far and fast\\n\\nThey mumbled, fumbled, tumbled\\n\\nEach one more weary than the last\\n\\n\\n\\nThe veil was torn asunder\\n\\n‘Tween the hours of twelve and one\\n\\nNo change, no sudden wonder\\n\\nCould undo what had been done\\n\\n\\n\\nThe watchman lay there dreaming\\n\\nAt fourty-five degrees\\n\\nHe dreamed the Titanic was sinking\\n\\nDropping to her knees\\n\\n\\n\\nWellington, he was sleeping\\n\\nHis bed began to slide\\n\\nHis valiant heart was beating\\n\\nHe pushed the tables aside\\n\\n\\n\\nGlass of shattered crystal\\n\\nLay scattered ‘round about\\n\\nHe strapped on both his pistols\\n\\nHow long could he hold out?\\n\\n\\n\\nHis men and his companions\\n\\nWere nowhere to be seen\\n\\nIn silence there he waited for\\n\\nTime and space to intervene\\n\\n\\n\\nThe passageway was narrow\\n\\nThere was blackness in the air\\n\\nHe saw every kind of sorrow\\n\\nHeard voices everywhere\\n\\n\\n\\nAlarm bells were ringing\\n\\nTo hold back the swelling tide\\n\\nFriends and lovers clinging\\n\\nTo each other side by side\\n\\n\\n\\nMothers and their daughters\\n\\nDescending down the stairs\\n\\nJumped into the icy waters\\n\\nLove and pity sent their prayers\\n\\n\\n\\nThe rich man, Mr. Astor\\n\\nKissed his darling wife\\n\\nHe had no way of knowing\\n\\nBe the last trip of his life\\n\\n\\n\\nCalvin, Blake and Wilson\\n\\nGambled in the dark\\n\\nNot one of them would ever live to\\n\\nTell the tale of disembark\\n\\n\\n\\nBrother rose up against brother\\n\\nIn every circumstance\\n\\nThey fought and slaughtered each other\\n\\nIn a deadly dance\\n\\n\\n\\nThey lowered down the lifeboats\\n\\nFrom the sinking wreck\\n\\nThere were traitors, there were turncoats\\n\\nBroken backs and broken necks\\n\\n\\n\\nThe bishop left his cabin\\n\\nTo help all those in need\\n\\nTurned his eyes up to the heavens\\n\\nSaid, “The poor are yours to feed.”\\n\\n\\n\\nDavey the brothel keeper\\n\\nCame out, dismissed his girls\\n\\nSaw the water getting deeper\\n\\nSaw the changing of his world\\n\\n\\n\\nJim Dandy smiled\\n\\nHe\\'d never learned to swim\\n\\nSaw the little crippled child\\n\\nAnd he gave his seat to him\\n\\n\\n\\nHe saw the starlight shining\\n\\nStreaming from the East\\n\\nDeath was on the rampage\\n\\nBut his heart was now at peace\\n\\n\\n\\nThey battened down the hatches\\n\\nBut the hatches wouldn’t hold\\n\\nThey drowned upon the staircase\\n\\nOf brass and polished gold\\n\\n\\n\\nLeo said to Cleo\\n\\n“I think I’m going mad.”\\n\\nBut he\\'d lost his mind already\\n\\nWhatever mind he had\\n\\n\\n\\nHe tried to block the doorway\\n\\nTo save all those from harm\\n\\nBlood from an open wound\\n\\nPouring down his arm\\n\\n\\n\\nPetals fell from flowers\\n\\n‘Til all of them were gone\\n\\nIn the long and dreadful hours\\n\\nThe wizard’s curse played on\\n\\n\\n\\nThe host was pouring brandy\\n\\nHe was going down slow\\n\\nHe stayed right ‘til the end\\n\\nHe was the last to go\\n\\n\\n\\nThere were many, many others\\n\\nNameless here forevermore\\n\\nThey\\'d never sailed the ocean\\n\\nOr left their homes before\\n\\n\\n\\nThe watchman, he lay dreaming\\n\\nThe damage had been done\\n\\nHe dreamed the Titanic was sinking\\n\\nAnd he tried to tell someone\\n\\n\\n\\nThe captain, barely breathing\\n\\nKneeling at the wheel\\n\\nAbove him and beneath him\\n\\nFifty thousand tons of steel\\n\\n\\n\\nHe looked over at his compass\\n\\nAnd he gazed into its face\\n\\nNeedle pointing downward\\n\\nHe knew he lost the race\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the dark illumination\\n\\nHe remembered bygone years\\n\\nHe read the Book of Revelation\\n\\nAnd he filled his cup with tears\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the Reaper’s task had ended\\n\\nSixteen hundred had gone to rest\\n\\nThe good, the bad, the rich, the poor\\n\\nThe loveliest and the best\\n\\n\\n\\nThey waited at the landing\\n\\nAnd they tried to understand\\n\\nBut there is no understanding\\n\\nOn the judgment of God’s hand\\n\\n\\n\\nNews came over the wires\\n\\nAnd struck with deadly force\\n\\nLove had lost its fires\\n\\nAll things had run their course\\n\\n\\n\\nThe watchman he lay dreaming\\n\\nOf all things that can be\\n\\nHe dreamed the Titanic was sinking\\n\\nInto the deep blue sea\\n\\n\\nListen to that Duquesne whistle blowin’\\n\\nBlowin’ like it’s gonna sweep my world away\\n\\nI’m gonna stop in Carbondale and keep on going\\n\\nThat Duquesne train gonna ride me night

Rubicon on the 14th day of the most dangerous month of the year\\n\\nAt the worst time at the worst place - that’s all I seem to hear\\n\\nI got up early so I could greet the Goddess of the Dawn\\n\\nI painted my wagon - I abandoned all hope and I crossed the Rubicon\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Rubicon is the Red River, going gently as she flows\\n\\nRedder then your ruby lips and the blood that flows from the rose\\n\\nThree miles north of purgatory - one step from the great beyond\\n\\nI prayed to the cross and I kissed the girls and I crossed the Rubicon\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat are these dark days I see in this world so badly bent\\n\\nHow can I redeem the time - the time so idly spent\\n\\nHow much longer can it last - how long can this go on\\n\\nI embraced my love put down my head and I crossed the Rubicon\\n\\n\\n\\nI feel the bones beneath my skin and they’re tremblin’ with rage\\n\\nI’ll make your wife a widow - you’ll never see old age\\n\\nShow me one good man in sight that the sun shines down upon\\n\\nI pawned my watch and I paid my debts and I crossed the Rubicon\\n\\n\\n\\nPut my heart upon the hill where some happiness I’ll find\\n\\nIf I survive then let me love - let the hour be mine\\n\\nTake the high road - take the low, take the one you’re on\\n\\nI poured the cup and I passed it along and I crossed the Rubicon\\n\\n\\n\\nYou defiled the most lovely flower in all of womanhood\\n\\nOthers can be tolerant - others can be good\\n\\nI’ll cut you up with a crooked knife and I’ll miss you when you’re gone\\n\\nI stood between heaven and earth and I crossed the Rubicon\\n\\n\\n\\nYou won’t find any happiness here - no happiness or joy\\n\\nGo back to the gutter and try your luck - find you some nice young pretty boy\\n\\nTell me how many men I need and who I can count upon\\n\\nI strapped my belt and buttoned my coat and I crossed the Rubicon\\n\\n\\n\\nI feel the Holy Spirit inside and see the light that freedom gives\\n\\nI believe it’s within the reach of every man who lives\\n\\nKeep as far away as possible - it’s darkest ‘fore the dawn\\n\\nI turned the key and I broke it off and I crossed the Rubicon\\n\\n\\n\\nMona Baby, are you still in my mind - I truly believe that you are\\n\\nCouldn’t be anybody else but you who’s come with me this far\\n\\nThe killing frost is on the ground and the autumn leaves are gone\\n\\nI lit the torch and I
